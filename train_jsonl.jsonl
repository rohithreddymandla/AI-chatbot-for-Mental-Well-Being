It's important to support your loved one if they are feeling this way. Feelings of hopelessness and depression, as well as previous suicide attempts, can indicate a risk for future attempts. Seeking help from a mental health professional or a hospital's emergency room is crucial in these situations. Evaluation for suicidal thoughts, intent, and plan is necessary, and if there is a danger to oneself, hospitalization may be necessary until stable. It's possible that your loved one may be suffering from Major Depressive Disorder or another depressive illness. In such cases, medication and gentle self-care can be beneficial. Don't forget to take care of yourself as well, as a suicide attempt affects not only the individual but also their loved ones.

In other words, it's not really something you can reach out and grab. It's more of a process. This is good news because you don't necessarily have to be at the end of the process to end an unhealthy relationship. We just have to accept that there will be feelings that come up even after the relationship is over. For example, someone can end an unhealthy relationship today, but then be reminded of the good times on what would have been their \"anniversary.\" This could make the person very sad. They may even regret ending the relationship for a little while. It would be important, then, for the person to remind themselves why the relationship needed to end and that they are healthier because of it. This is relevant for you. It's hard to walk away from a relationship. We fear all kinds of things, including being single. Sometimes it's helpful to compare what you are getting out of the relationship to what you want from a relationship. It's helpful to be honest about what we have given up for an unhealthy relationship. It's fine to admit uncertainty about ending things."}]}

While counselors work closely with medical providers, and sometimes have discussions about medications with people, we rarely make recommendations about how much or what type of medication a person should be taking. This is because prescribing and advising on medication is out of our scope of practice. The only exception would be if a counselor is also a physician, nurse practitioner, physician's assistant, etc. Having said that, I certainly understand that anxiety is a real serious problem that many folks struggle with. If you are currently not in therapy to help you with these panic attacks, you should consider it. Medications can be helpful for anxiety, and medications like Xanax may help for immediate relief, but they do nothing to deal with the root of anxiety and may not help with anxiety long-term. Therapists who have experience in exposure therapies would be good people to start with. Exposure therapy has good outcomes for people with anxiety disorders and panic attacks. If you are interested in speaking with your provider about the Xanax, I think explaining it the way you did on here is just fine. The provider will then decide if they feel comfortable increasing your medication. Please remember that medical providers are not trying to give people a hard time. Medications like Xanax really are highly addictive. The more you take, the more you may feel you need. The more often you may feel you need to use it.

Often, cognitive distortions are the issue. Some common cognitive distortions include catastrophizing (predicting the worst), future telling, black and white thinking (if it's not perfect, it's terrible), mind reading (e.g. \"I just know he is angry at me\"), and can't stand it-ism (e.g. \"I can't stand this situation\"). There are more, but the list is long. If some of these resonate with you, I would advise looking up CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) tips, worksheets, booklets, etc. online, or contacting a local CBT therapist. Another helpful piece of information on anxiety is that it is prone to something called \"symptom stress\" - being anxious about anxiety. If we could hear this symptom stress, it might sound like, \"Oh no, I'm getting nervous about this, I'm getting uptight, I look nervous, what if I have a panic attack,\" followed by more cognitive distortions such as \"I can't stand being anxious\" and \"this is horrible.\" The antidote to this is acceptance.

Notice if your anxiety feels like excitement, concerns, or fear. It seems like you are excited about your new job, but worried because others are telling you that you have anxiety. Let's notice how others' input is affecting your thoughts and maybe causing more anxiety that you may really have. If you are indeed experiencing anxiety, that does not mean that you will have panic attacks. But if you are experiencing panic attacks, or suffer them at some point, you could learn how to reduce them either with therapy or medication. You can learn how to process it depending on what triggers it and channel it in a useful way. For example, you could plan a schedule around your new job and be meticulous about it because you are worried about how your new job may affect your routine, or you could feel overwhelmed with your schedule, focus on the feeling, but not do anything about it. Notice the difference? The key is in recognizing if you are anxious about something that you can change or have control over it, and take action if you do, and recognizing when you cannot control things and be okay with not being in control.

Children go through stages of exploration until they develop a sense of social confidence. Depending on your son's age, he might need some input or advice.

If you or your counselor uses an integral approach, ensuring to check the four irreducible perspectives - subjective, intersubjective, objective, and interobjective (also known as the four quadrants) - in determining where the challenges are, it then becomes possible to identify what might be contributing to or causing the challenge, as well as offering ways to address the situation.\n\nIn this case, from a behavioral and physical perspective, we would want to make sure there are no physical limitations or ailments, meaning that you would need to visit your doctor and have the basics checked, such as blood pressure. We would also look at particular behaviors to see if you are doing something that is affecting performance, such as excessive masturbation or being influenced by pornography.\n\nNext, we would look at the thoughts, cognitions, identity, and feelings, to see what is going on both during sexual activities and at other times. If you are worried about your job, your family, or under immense pressure to perform at work or during intimate moments, this can contribute to your situation. \n\nWe would then turn to the cultural rules and tools to see how you have learned to interpret challenges that come up during sex and look for ways to shift, update, and reshape the way you view sex and its challenges.

Entertaining a tough is only going to make it a stronger target. Careful with that friendship. You do not want to fill your marriage's void with another person. Even when you are in a friend zone and not having intimacy with this person, you may be developing a special bond, sharing interests and activities that may lead to a deeper connection. Ask yourself how you would feel if your partner was having a friendship like that. Then try to refocus on your marriage. I suggest being transparent and talking to your partner about your feelings and concerns. Ask them what you could do to reconnect, make some suggestions, and dedicate time to practice them. Make time in both of your schedules, make an effort to have meals together, or to communicate during the day. Remember that a marriage is like a very good friendship with benefits, but sometimes the responsibility kills the fun."}]}

There is unfortunately still a lot of negative stigma associated with people who express their gender or sexuality in ways that differ from the majority.

We grow up being exposed to certain assumptions and beliefs about what is \"acceptable\" behavior and even face consequences sometimes if we don't \"fit in\" the way others tell us to. Even if those assumptions are harmful and wrong, we still internalize them and feel guilty about who we are. There is nothing wrong with us, but feeling stigmatized and isolated can lead to feelings of shame, embarrassment, or like something is \"wrong\" with us.\n\nBut there is absolutely nothing wrong with you, so be proud of who you are and what you enjoy.

Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy. Unfortunately, this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack. There are ways you can deal with controlling parents and most of them require creating a plan of action. Examples of action plans:\n\n- Decide in advance how you'll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they're trying to control you\n- Arrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you're losing control\n- Talk in person to an adult you trust.

Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with anxiety and depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with anxiety and depression are a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy with mindfulness, and solution-focused brief therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms is part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together show the most effective outcome for depression. The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time.

In my practice, I educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety:\n\n1. Starting a daily mindfulness practice, for example, listening to guided meditation, engaging in deep breathing exercises, yoga practice, or other positive calming activities.\n2. Understanding your negative and positive thoughts. Many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen. Increase positive self-talk when feeling down or anxious. For example, \"I don't need to worry, I am calm and relaxed\".\n3. Exposure to fearful or anxious situations. This can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional. Many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure. This may lead to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do, for example, leaving the house, presenting in front of others, going to social events, and having conversations with people.

Your ex-partner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you. It's a form of abuse and child abuse. He's likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you, and he's not considering how it's affecting the kids. I've seen this happen in many families - parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent. In some cases, children actually stop having contact with one parent, who is left bewildered and powerless. It's your ex's job to support your relationship with your kids, not try to destroy it.\n\nWhile you can't change his behaviors, and I think you know that, there are things you can do for yourself and your kids. For your children, you can refuse to enter into the war he's setting up. He's trying to provoke you into acting \"crazy\", but you don't have to fall for this. If you run around screaming \"he's lying\", it only makes you look more 'crazy'. Try to stay calm, and don't put their dad down to them, no matter how tempting it is. One day, they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father, but wait until they ask. Trust that they have their own experience of their dad, and trust that he doesn't have the power to destroy their love for you. Children, in the long term, lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent. They see who their dad is already, I'd bet, but they don't know how to cope with that. If he's the only one fighting a war, you're helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict. Don't engage on his level.\n\nDon't blame your children completely. Although I have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you don't need to tolerate that disrespect, try to deal with this behavior without bringing their dad into it. They are acting out their father's agenda, likely because they instinctively see his weakness. Children often support the weaker parent, rather than abandon them. You get the worst because they trust your love. But you can still have boundaries. Letting them abuse you isn't the answer, but have compassion for their position. This picture isn't their fault, but as adults, they can be held accountable for their choices. Reassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are. You don't need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices. Hold onto the likelihood that someday, they will come back and be grateful. It may take a while, you can't rush it, but they will see you for who you are. Your power is in giving them a consistently calm, generous, connected, supportive mom who refuses to play games or be walked on.\n\nI'd recommend trying to connect with other parents who experience this phenomenon, or a therapist who can reinforce these goals and help keep you grounded.

For some individuals, it's a game to see how much power they have over you, or it's their need to control you. If you don't want any contact from this person, it's crucial to clearly communicate your boundaries by saying \"Don't contact me again,\" and then ignore all of their messages. Any interaction or response from you will only encourage their behavior. Remind yourself why you don't want to be with them. I hear you doing that already when you say \"he has nothing to offer me.\" That's great self-talk.\n\nBut let's discuss why it's difficult to let go of people like this. Sometimes, it's because we still hope they will change. We may remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us, and we think it can go back to how it felt in those \"good old days.\" However, during the initial years of intimacy, people tend to show more of who they really are, not less. So, what they're eventually showing you is their true selves and what they're capable of. People can change and grow, but it won't happen at your pace. Accept them for who they are and stop expecting them to change.\n\nAnother reason we can't let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future, wondering if they will be a better person for their next partner. This thought is normal, but not healthy. It's as though we want them to stay, apologize, heal our wounds, and make up for past mistakes. You deserve healing, you deserve better than what you got, and you deserve apologies. However, expecting all of this from the person who hurt you and hasn't shown compassion yet is probably unwise.\n\nI believe that underlying some of the scenarios mentioned above is the deep belief that we are somehow responsible for the pain our exes caused. If you blame yourself in any way for someone's mistreatment of you, you will keep trying to change yourself so that they can treat you better. Let me remind you that their actions are about them, not you, and the only solution is to challenge and minimize thoughts of them and create distance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dboth physically and emotionally.

That makes sense. Each time we have a breakup, we are a bit more in touch with how much is at stake in this whole love and relationship business. We are falling in love and letting someone close to our hearts, and there's vulnerability in that we can get hurt. Who you partner with long-term is a big decision and it determines 90% of our happiness in life. The good news is that when we're just starting to get to know someone, we can take it slow. I think maybe you are slowing yourself down instinctively here, and that's okay. We are naturally people of attachment and it won't likely last if you are normally an open and accessible person who doesn't put up walls. So part of what I want to say here is don't pressure yourself too much. Take the time to heal naturally and listen to your instinct that is telling you to take things slow. As well, there are a few things you can do to make sure that the walls do eventually come down, or will come down for the right person. First, think about the lessons you learned from this past relationship. What do you feel proud of? What do you need in a partner? What mistakes did you make? Use this experience to grow in your awareness of how you work in a relationship and what you need from a partner. Look at your thoughts. Are you having generalized negative thoughts like \"No one will ever love me again?\" or \"I'm going to get hurt again\" or \"I can't trust myself\"? If so, write down what these thoughts are, and then ask yourself what evidence supports these thoughts. Fear tries to convince us that there is either something wrong with us or that something bad will happen, but it does so with little or no evidence of this ever happening. It sells us a line based on no concrete evidence. Then ask yourself what evidence supports the opposite thought. What is the evidence that I am lovable... that there are safe, good people out there... that I can trust myself? Eliminate the negative thoughts and add the positive ones. It's simple but very powerful. Lastly, take concrete and careful steps to act as though there are no walls. What is the evidence of the walls? Can you take purposeful baby steps in the direction of lowering those walls? When we act as though something is true, we start to feel it and believe it more.

I'd like to hear some ways I can work on not needing to feel so much in control all the time.\n(Anxiety Parenting)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, Biddeford. This is a super goal. Feeling powerless is something parents are wise to get used to. There's a creature in the home whose job is to find and use their power in the family and in the world. Of course, your toddler defies you, and that's healthy. I worry more about the overly compliant ones. She is wanting to know what the rules are, and all you have to do is show her clearly where the lines are. I'll give you some tips.\n\nFirst, remind yourself that it's her job to learn what the rules are and where her power is. Don't be surprised when she wants it her way. If we go through our days being ready and prepared for these beautiful creatures to have minds of their own, we're less caught off guard when it happens.\n\nAvoid situations that invite power struggles. Any time you tell your daughter \"do this now,\" you set up a power struggle. The good thing is that she's young enough you can pick her up. Now is the time to teach her that mom's or dad's word means something. So, if you say \"let's get you dressed,\" then be prepared to pick her up right away and show her that when you say something will happen, you can make it happen. And I'm talking about gently picking her up here\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not roughly. Pick your battles; only give instructions when you have the power to make it happen.\n\nGive her choices, so she can see her power. Instead of opening her drawer and asking what she wants to wear, give her two choices. Here's an example: she's on the iPad, and you say iPad time is over. She says \"no\". You can say \"iPad time is over. If you put it down, you can play later. If I have to take it away, you don't play it later.\" The choice is hers. Then follow through.\n\n\"When...then\" statements are really helpful. Your child asks for something. Instead of saying no, try \"as soon as the toys are picked up, we can have a snack\". You're simply a pleasant parent who wants the same thing they do... but they have to earn it.\n\nStaying calm yourself is the key because then at least you will feel in control of yourself, which is the ultimate goal. Use self-talk to calm yourself. Remind yourself her behavior is normal and healthy. Breathe through a moment in which you would have reacted, and it will be over by the time the breath is done. You can give yourself time to think before you make parenting decisions. Time is a useful tool not enough parents use. Good luck."}]}

I've suffered from depression ever since the breakup and have been unable to connect with anyone else. It's damaging me and my life.\n(Relationship Dissolution  Depression Social Relationships)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm sorry that you've lost the love you had. The fact that you were planning on getting married and building a future together indicates that you held a special place in each other's hearts. However, things have changed now and you're no longer together. Accepting this reality might be challenging for you, but it's crucial for your well-being. You've been grieving for a longer time than the duration of your relationship. It's important to understand that you're still stuck in your feelings for her instead of moving forward. Unrequited love can lead to long-lasting heartache. Let's consider some potential obstacles that are preventing you from moving on.\n\nPerhaps there are unresolved issues for you. Maybe you were hurt and never had the opportunity to express your feelings, or maybe you hurt her and didn't have a chance to make amends. It's possible that there's a burning question you need to ask or something else you want to say. You might even want to let her know that you still love her and see if she feels the same way. In such a case, you have two choices. You can reach out and communicate what's on your mind, or you can stop dwelling on these thoughts and let them go. If you decide to reach out, there's no guarantee that the outcome will be positive or that she will even respond. You could consider writing a letter to her but not sending it, or you can choose to send it. It might be worth taking the risk. The following paragraph will help you make a decision.\n\nDo you know how she feels about you? How did the relationship end? Did she end it? Was the distance the reason behind the breakup, or were there other underlying differences that caused the relationship to fail? Sometimes, when people are deeply in love, they fail to realize that the other person no longer shares the same feelings. Consider the information you have about what she wants in life. Can you respect and support her needs? If she has asked for distance, it would be wise for you to honor her request.\n\nA key aspect of moving forward is examining your thoughts and identifying where you're getting stuck. Write down your thoughts and determine what negative consequences you associate with letting go. For example, \"If I let go, something bad might happen\" or \"Moving forward would mean...\". Continue exploring these thoughts and pinpoint the worst possible outcome. This kind of introspection can help you identify the areas where you're feeling stuck.\n\nIt's possible that you've interpreted the end of this relationship as a reflection of yourself or your future in a negative light. For instance, you may think, \"If this person doesn't love me, then I must be unlovable\" or \"No one will ever love me as much as she did\". Holding onto your feelings for her is your way of rejecting these negative beliefs about yourself or your future. Can you find a different way to challenge and reject these beliefs? Try repeating the following affirmations to yourself:\n\n- I know that she loved me. There is evidence of her love.\n- I was a good partner. There is evidence of my positive qualities.\n- Falling in love and moving on are normal parts of life. I have the strength to learn and grow from this experience.\n- Many people appreciate and value me; that's how I know I am worthy of love.\n- It's natural to feel sadness. I'm allowed to grieve the loss of love.\n- I want to look ahead and not dwell on the past.\n- I believe that more love awaits me in the future, but I need to overcome my fears.\n- If this person loved me, others can too, but I need to let go of past memories.\n\nThese are the kinds of topics a therapist would explore with you. I wish you well in your journey."}]}

The younger the child is, in general, the more I would see this as their decision, not theirs. A child of any age should be listened to carefully about these matters but just because a child has unresolved issues about a parent doesn't necessarily mean that having contact is a good solution. Some questions... Was the parent harmful to the child? Is the parent likely to be harmful to the child? How likely is it to be a positive experience? Do you have any contact with the parent? You may want to speak with the parent first to determine whether they are in a stable enough place to allow this to happen. I would start by asking the child more about what is on their mind. What do they want to get out of a visit with the parent? Is it to see them and know the parent is okay, to get an apology, to apologize for a perceived hurt, to have regular contact, to find out if they are loved...? What do they hope mom or dad might do or say in the visit? There are many possible goals this child might have in mind. This will give you a sense of what's missing for the child, what need are they trying to fill. Once you know the need, try to determine the likelihood of that need being met successfully through contact. Once you determine the risk of the child's need not being met, then you decide whether it makes sense. The older the child, the more able they are to determine this with you or for themselves. There are other options than face-to-face. They can write to their mom or dad, text or email. It's likely that the child is looking for a sense that they are loved, wanted, worth some effort. When a child is separated from a parent, they tend to blame themselves. Whether they see the parent or not, they will need extra love, attention, and support than a child who has two loving, present parents. I wish them the best and I'm grateful for the love and support you continue to give your grandchild. You're very special."}]}

I don't think these thoughts are normal.\n(Anxiety Spirituality)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there, what you're experiencing is indeed anxiety. It's very common, and through research, we know a lot about how to reduce anxiety. I'll get you started, and it's a great idea to connect with a therapist who can build on these ideas and get to know you well.\n\nIt's natural to have random thoughts that unsettle us. Our brains are complex, wonderful things. Fearful and anxious thoughts are a part of this picture \u00e2\u20ac\u201c their purpose is to prepare us for the future and to help us make sense of the past and learn from it. But what happens sometimes is that our alarm systems get out of whack and get set off too easily. We often spend too much time worrying about things that happened or might happen. When these thoughts take away from our enjoyment of life, it becomes a problem. \n\nSo, while fear and anxiety try to protect us, they also seek power and will take any power they can get. In general, fear and anxiety try to tell us one or both of two things: that something is wrong with us, or that something bad will happen because there's something wrong with us. They will use anything they can as evidence to convince you. For example, \"That person looked at you funny. You're strange looking.\" Well, there are dozens of possible explanations for the look on that person's face, and it's unlikely it had anything to do with you.\n\nFor you personally, your thoughts are about the afterlife and living forever. What does fear tell you will be uncomfortable about living forever? What would the worst part be? A therapist would help you dig deep to find the core of what you fear. It might be that you have no control over who you are or where you go. It might be that you fear going to hell because you're \"bad\". Search for that deepest fear.\n\nI invite you then to picture that thought as a glass of water on a shelf. It's a heavy glass, and if you held it in your hands for a while and stared at it, it would get in the way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you'd be uncomfortable and unable to focus on your life. That's what's happening now. I suggest that the problem is not so much the thought you're having. We all have random silly thoughts that usually aren't true. The problem is how long you're holding it in your hand. You could have that thought, pick up that glass a hundred times a day, and as long as you put it right back on the shelf, it's not a problem. The trick is to get it back on that shelf.\n\nRight now, you're using distraction to do this. You're trying to focus on other things around you, but I think the glass is still in your hand. It's not enough \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you're looking for more tools to get that glass back on the shelf. And the key is in your thoughts. Once you find out what fear is trying to tell you, then you can \"talk back to\" fear. So, as an example, if fear is saying to you, \"You have no control over anything,\" then you can work to accept the pieces you don't have control over, learn to tolerate that feeling, and claim back the pieces you can control. You can control the extent to which you let fear take you over.\n\nWith a therapist, you can learn to \"refute\" fear's ideas. You can learn to look for concrete evidence of fear's lies and gain back control over your thoughts. I wish you the best."}]}

Relationships don't tend to last when we treat people poorly. It is very possible for you to learn different ways of relating with some strong effort. I would highly suggest working with a therapist, and I will give you a few things to think about in the meantime.\n\nSometimes anger is there because we feel something is unjust or unfair, but many times, anger is a \"secondary emotion,\" and it's simply there to protect us from other, more vulnerable emotions that we would rather not feel and will do anything to avoid. Discovering what vulnerable emotions you are protecting yourself from is important. Perhaps you feel powerless, unloved, or unimportant. It may take some time before you recognize this emotion.\n\nOnce you do, you can ask yourself about the other times in your life when you have felt that emotion. Where did it originate? At what age did you feel \"too much\" of that feeling...so much so that you can't stand it even in tiny amounts?\n\nYou will learn in therapy to identify the thoughts you have that are connected to that feeling. They are typically incorrect thoughts, like \"No one loves me\" or \"People will always hurt me.\" Fear tends to generalize and predict bad things that aren't likely.\n\nYour habit is so strong that you likely have a poor sense of self-worth and you don't believe people will love you...so you hurt them to keep them at a distance. This happens at a subconscious level. Do you see how that would help you keep people off balance or afraid or at a distance if you didn't believe in your worth? So, it's really backwards because you think you're getting mad at people who \"piss you off,\" but you're really just not wanting to face how mad you are at yourself.\n\nIn addition to this work, you can start to intentionally treat people more kindly. Find out what respect is, make amends, and resolve to spread peace. It might sound too simple, but if you act as though you're a person of peace, you will start to feel more peaceful.\n\nBut I hope you do contact a therapist. It will take time and support to reach your goal."}]}

You mention that you experience anger, but you don't provide any specific details about how it manifests. Perhaps it doesn't manifest at all. Are you typically aggressive with your partner? Considering your mention of depression, I wonder if you tend to internalize your anger rather than expressing it openly. If that's the case, I commend your ability to refrain from lashing out at someone who may be causing you pain. However, if you keep your emotions entirely suppressed, anger can transform into depression. When your partner yells at you, how do you react? Is that when you feel the most anger? It wouldn't be surprising, as anger is a natural response to being yelled at. \n\nThere's something about anger that often serves as a cover-up for more vulnerable emotions. Beneath the anger, I wonder if you feel worthless, powerless, scared, or unloved. A key aspect of reducing anger is identifying these underlying emotions and expressing them. \n\nYou mention that you are unsure about dealing with life, but I believe you may actually be referring to difficulties in managing your emotions.

You are lucky to have a loving, compassionate partner, and your partner is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions.\n\nMy hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here. Your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made. You don't have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good person. You only have to have the maturity to recognize when you've hurt someone and work hard to make it better. Who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made? Were you shamed as a child? Did you learn that you deserved to be punished? Did something bad happen that you thought was your fault? Is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for? There is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they weren't entirely responsible for. The bar is too high for you. If I was your therapist, I would work with you to find the source of the shame, and address that wound.\n\nIf you want to move forward and be with your partner, your job will be to forgive yourself. Forgiving doesn't mean \"it was okay\", forgiving simply means that it happened, that you can't erase it, and that you don't want to carry it around or punish yourself for it anymore.\n\nYou have done many things here that you can feel proud of. You've 'come clean', you've been honest, you've taken responsibility for your actions, you've not tried to minimize what you did, and you've chosen to be more loyal and aware of how you impact your partner. These are all things you can use to build your sense of worth. You are acting very honorably. It's time to put your past mistakes away on the shelf knowing that you've learned from them and are a better person now. It's not our mistakes, not our worst moments that define us, it's how we handle them afterwards.\n\nI wish you growth and happiness."}]}

If we feel successful in that area, it can give us the confidence and hope to tackle anything life throws at us. There are personal barriers we all have to having healthy relationships it's our \"stuff\", our \"baggage\" not a steam trunk, right...you have a cute little bag. You hint that people may have hurt you in the past. Maybe fear says \"stay away...hold onto resentment or you will be hurt again\". Resentment, or simply focusing on the past is certainly a barrier to improving any relationship. Learning to forgive ourselves and others is so important. And remember...forgiveness isn't about saying something was okay it only means \"It happened, I can't change that, and I don't want to carry it anger, hurt, resentment around anymore, so I let it go.\" Or...sometimes fear tells us that people won't accept us this keeps us isolated for sure But really, all fear wants is power over us. Fear is a trickster. It tells us that if we let go of the past, we will be rejected or hurt. It says \"I'm trying to protect you\", but what it really wants is to paralyze and isolate us all so it can feel powerful. Once you pull the clothing off of fear, you can see that it doesn't help you at all. Once you see where your personal barriers are, and you start to refute those thoughts in your mind, you can begin to build new ideas about yourself and other people that are based on compassion instead of fear. Everyone deserves forgiveness and compassion. No one deserves to be judged by their worst moments. If I look in the rearview mirror, I can't move forward. We are all beautifully imperfect. I can't change the past, but I have the power to make the future good. I wish you the best on your journey."}]}

If there is evidence that your mom wants to respect you moving forward, then it might be worth it to risk putting down the resentment and the grudge that you think you need to protect yourself. Your ability to draw boundaries with her in the present is your biggest protector - let her know in the present what hurts you, and notice her responses. You don't have to say it to her face.

I have grounded him, but nothing works. What should I do?\n(Parenting)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, you sound like a sensitive parent. I like that you talked to your child to see if anything is wrong. There is some important information missing here. I don't know your child's age, whether they spent any money, whether they put the card back, or how many times they have stolen. My answer might be different depending on those details, but I'll give you my thoughts.\n\nI believe it is every child's job to figure out the rules and find their power in the world. Testing limits is a common behavior for many children. They often ask themselves, \"What can I get away with?\" in order to find the answer. If a child knows the rules, they are less likely to test the limits because they already know what they are. Therefore, part of testing limits includes experimenting with stealing and lying. Not all children steal, but I would say that almost every child lies at some point. It is a normal behavior, and most of the time it involves small things that don't matter and we may never find out about.\n\nStealing a debit card is a more serious offense, and it's not surprising that your child lied about it. If you are absolutely sure that they took it, it's okay to tell them that you believe they did this and also lied about it. It's appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behavior, so that the child understands it is not acceptable. The consequence should be as natural and logical as possible. Stealing the debit card was harmful to you, so perhaps having them do extra chores would be a good idea.\n\nIt's interesting how as parents, we try to teach our children that lying is bad, but they know that they will face consequences if they tell the truth. There are natural deterrents to being honest because we don't want people to know about our mistakes. It's a dilemma. If you really want to focus on the lying part, you can tell your child that you won't give them a consequence for lying if they decide to come clean with the truth within one day. That gives them an incentive to come to you with the truth. Sometimes, giving kids a chance to be honest and rewarding them for telling the truth works.\n\nYou can set your child up for success by teaching them the importance of honesty. For example, you can put a cookie on the counter and tell your child to take the cookie at some point during the day. Later, ask them if they took the cookie. This makes honesty fun and engaging. Kids love games.\n\nIn essence, rewarding positive behavior can be just as powerful as punishing negative behavior. If this is your son's first serious offense, don't make a big deal out of it. Give him a consequence and see if he learns from it. However, if this behavior becomes a pattern, it may be helpful to seek the input of a therapist."}]}

Right now, you can pleasantly ignore her hints. They're not hurting you and if you ignore them, they're more likely to go away. You can address and reduce your own anxiety about the possibility of her asking by reassuring yourself that you have the right as parents to make this decision, and that if she's offended, that doesn't mean that you're being mean, it means that she has unrealistic expectations.

It's important to recognize that some individuals may engage in infidelity while others do not. However, it's crucial to give our partners the benefit of the doubt unless they display signs of untrustworthiness. There are two aspects to consider in addressing this issue. Firstly, if you want to develop a more trusting mindset, you should examine your thoughts and behaviors.\n\nIt seems that your thoughts are trapped in negative patterns, similar to tires stuck in deep ruts on a road. These thoughts are merely habits and do not necessarily reflect reality. Fear might be influencing your thinking, whispering phrases like \"everyone cheats\" or \"you're not enough for him\". Once you identify the message that fear is trying to convey, visualize those words in red when they arise. Then, ask yourself about the proof supporting those thoughts. You will likely find little or no evidence to support them. In contrast, remind yourself that there are many good men, that you deserve love and loyalty, and that there are no signs of infidelity. By challenging and refuting fear-based thoughts, you can begin to break free from their hold. Practice these thoughts regularly to reinforce positive thinking.\n\nThe second aspect involves your behaviors. Act as if you trust your boyfriend. Resist the urge to constantly check or question him. The less you engage in these behaviors, the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel. It may feel unnatural at first, but acting \"as if\" something is true can actually help foster genuine belief. Remember that changing our thoughts can ultimately transform our emotions.\n\nTo initiate this process, you might consider seeking the assistance of a therapist who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy. They can provide support and guidance in exploring the underlying reasons behind your current struggles and help you develop strategies to overcome them. I wish you the best of luck in this journey."}]}

However, keep in mind that the situation you have described only provides a limited understanding of the larger picture.\n\nIn the meantime, it might be helpful to approach the issue with empathy and understanding towards your wife. She may be going through pain or discomfort, making it difficult for her to engage in sexual activities. It is important to communicate your feelings of loneliness and hurt to her, instead of only expressing anger. Demonstrating irritability or anger might push her further away.\n\nRemember, there are various ways to foster closeness, intimacy, and sexual satisfaction that do not necessarily involve intercourse. You could explore these alternatives and assure your wife that you will not pressure her into engaging in sexual intercourse.

This is a new term for me... \"semirelationship\". What does it mean? I know that today's culture for young people is more of a \"hookup\" culture than a dating one. Maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore. That makes me feel sad. I hear a lot of young women say that they struggle with hookups because they can't let themselves hope for a phone call after a hookup. Research tells us that, after a hookup, college-age women tend to feel used and unworthy, and men tend to feel guilty. I think this scenario works better for men than women, but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the end. This is only one possible explanation for your anxiety... that your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether it's okay to want or expect that. Maybe take a moment and listen to anxiety. Anxiety tends to try to convince us that something's wrong with us or something bad's going to happen. Anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague; it's more difficult to refute it then, but you can try to clarify its whisperings by asking yourself these questions: What am I afraid of? What is the worst thing that might happen here? Then what might happen, and what would be the worst part of that? Keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen. Might someone not want you? Might you feel rejected? Or feel not good enough? You might get hurt? Then when you find that core fear, you can look at your life and I bet you'd find a place where that idea or fear originated. A big moment or many smaller ones when you actually DID feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt. In the end, it's a feeling you're trying to avoid, not life or relationship, and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious. But this doesn't work for you.

You don't tell us whether you live together or not. If you do, your position is perhaps more difficult because his daughter's behaviors affect you while living in the home. A bottom line for me is you don't tell someone else how to parent. That's for your boyfriend to decide. When he's there, he's the parent, and he makes the decisions about how she is disciplined or not. Even if you have good ideas or you completely disagree, or you think you see something that he's not seeing, it's simply not for you to interfere there. \n\nIt sounds like your boyfriend is struggling emotionally and needs support. He has had a lot of losses in his life, and maybe every time his daughter leaves, he feels powerless and abandoned. Do you talk about these things? Can you find that line of supporting him but not telling him what to do?\n\nAlthough I suggest you leave the parenting to him, what you can do is tell him what you see, offer suggestions if he's open to it, and talk about the ways in which the situation affects you. It makes sense to say \"I see you struggling, and I don't know how to help,\" \"I've noticed that you seem afraid to discipline her. Are you aware that it's coming across this way? Do you need help?\" or \"I feel sad and frustrated when we don't spend any time alone together.\"\n\nYou sound a bit resentful of his daughter. Is it possible that your real struggle is about whether you're ready to be in a relationship with a man whose priority is his child?\n\nYou have a voice, and it's great to offer support and ideas and let him know how you feel. Ultimately, however, you are wise to accept this man as who he is and accept the situation for what it is, and make your own decision about whether you want to be a part of it."}]}

For our New Year's resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on boardno more drinking every night.

He is a good husband in every other regard.\n(Addiction Marriage Intimacy)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, So your spouse is giving you conflicting messages. They claim to be willing to reduce their alcohol consumption, but they continue to drink secretly. Their behavior is passive-aggressive and immature, which puts you in the position of being a disapproving parent. It seems like you're dealing with an unruly teenager rather than a partner.\n\nYour spouse's dishonesty is sending a message. Perhaps it's \"I have the right to make my own decisions, and you can't control me.\" Beneath that, maybe it's \"I want to quit, but I feel ashamed that I can't, and I don't want you to witness my failures.\" Ultimately, as adults, we have the autonomy to choose what we consume. If you try to manage their drinking by keeping track of the number of beers they have, you'll likely encounter some negative consequences, resistance, or backlash.\n\nHow does their drinking affect you? Your voice holds power in this area. It's better to focus on that rather than counting beers or setting them up to lie when they're unconscious. Asking if they've been drinking when they've passed out is confusing. You've mentioned that they snore, which I suppose is a valid complaint. If they're passing out regularly, that's a genuine concern. Do they drive or behave aggressively when they drink? Do they disconnect from the relationship and avoid you? These are all valid concerns, and it's best to discuss them instead of fixating on beer count.\n\nI suspect that your spouse has limited coping mechanisms for stress, so they turn to alcohol to numb themselves and evade dealing with your relationship. However, this only exacerbates the situation; the more they distance themselves from you, the more you pursue them with your questions.\n\nA helpful conversation to have is one that goes like this: \"I've tried supporting you in drinking less, and it hasn't been effective. What are your goals when it comes to alcohol, and how can I better support you?\" It would be great to reach a point where you're not micromanaging their drinking but instead focusing on the aspects that directly impact you. What specific supportive strategies can you both agree on? Can you remove alcohol from the house? Is your spouse open to seeking treatment?\n\nClearly communicate your expectations. Say, \"I won't keep tabs on your beer consumption, but I can't tolerate dishonesty.\" Ultimately, you have to determine what's truly important to you. Is it solely the quantity of beer, or is it something deeper? What changes do you need to see in order to want to stay in the marriage? And what does your spouse require? Do they express their own boundaries effectively? They may struggle to articulate their needs.\n\nThe issue of drinking is just one aspect of the complex dynamics within your marriage. It would be beneficial to involve a qualified therapist who can help unravel and understand these complexities, and guide you both in developing healthier ways of relating to each other."}]}

These modern methods of meeting individuals are fantastic because they provide exposure to a diverse array of people whom we might not encounter at the supermarket or a friend's gathering. However, there are complications, and one of the drawbacks is that you can develop a strong emotional connection and genuine care for someone before ever meeting them in person. Subsequently, when you do meet in person and that magnetic physical attraction is absent, you find yourself in a challenging situation because you have already established a connection based on other aspects. It can be quite awkward then to express, \"Now that I have met you, it doesn't feel the way I anticipated.\" In the future, I suggest arranging an early in-person meeting to address the crucial question, \"Do we have a physical attraction towards each other?\" This is not only important for you, but for most individuals.\n\nI surmise that you feel obligated to offer this man your affection and commitment, despite not being particularly enamored with him (as indicated by your interest in other men).

Just because you do not find yourself attracted to him does not make you a bad person, nor does it imply that he is unattractive.

My brain barely works anymore, and my memory so small, I forget in a moment. I serve no purpose. I'm incapable of work or anything of value, and I never have been.

Sometimes when working with clients experiencing depression or anxiety, I ask them about their darkest thoughts. \"What are the worst thoughts that go through your mind?\" They often struggle, maybe out of shame or fear of being judged. However, knowing their worst thoughts can help me provide better support because we have a starting point. You feel hopeless and worthless, and your thoughts reinforce these intense emotions.\n\nAlthough I don't know you personally, I firmly believe that there is someone in your life who would hear your thoughts and say, \"That's not true. I know your worth.\" I believe that there are people who can see your true value, even in the small things. Can you imagine hearing those voices?\n\nSince you mentioned God, let's bring God into the conversation. What might God say to you? What evidence might God, who sees all, have of your worth? Perhaps God could give you a hint about your purpose.\n\nYou suffer from severe anxiety, and agoraphobia works in tandem with fear. Fear tells you that people will reject you or that something equally terrible will happen, and then agoraphobia comes in and traps you, using the fact that it seems like no one is reaching out to you as evidence that you have no worth. Can you see their plan? They want to make you scared, keep you isolated, and convince you that it's hopeless. However, they are both lying to you. They only want power over you.\n\nYou forget your worth. You forget that we all have worth. No one is a waste. I believe that all of God's creatures have worth, and we are here to use our gifts to make the world a better place and to remind one another of our value. There are people out there who need your support just as much as you need theirs. Can you find them? I suspect that you have been alone and isolated for a long time, making it impossible for you to see your worth in this situation. We need others to see our worth, and other people serve as mirrors. We can see our value reflected in their eyes.\n\nDo you remember the first time you questioned your worth? What was happening that made you blame yourself? Can you speak to that child and reassure them that whatever was happening was not their fault? It is that child who cannot see their own worth, probably because someone treated them as if they didn't have any. However, that is just a story, not the truth. Can you find another narrative? Who might speak to your worth?\n\nOak Harbor, I believe that help is closer than you think. Fear wants you to believe that it's hopeless. You reached out here, so can you reach out again? Start with just one person, and that will lead you somewhere. We don't know where that somewhere is, but could it be better than staying alone? You have stopped living, but you can choose any moment to start again.\n\nI wish you peace and hope."}]}

When you're in a relationship, it's natural to expect warmth and affection to continue. However, when these feelings fade, it can leave you feeling lonely. There could be underlying issues in the relationship or your partner may be dealing with hormonal or sexual difficulties.\n\nFinding the right solution is subjective and entirely up to you. Allow me to ask you some questions to help guide you in exploring your next steps. Besides sexual intimacy, does your partner show love and support in other ways? Does she communicate her needs and desires to you? Does she explain what obstacles prevent sexual intimacy? By recognizing that her behavior is not personal, but rather a reflection of her own issues, you can better cope with the rejection.\n\nIn my opinion, if couples therapy hasn't proven beneficial, it might be time for your partner to take ownership of the hurdles she faces and seek help from her physician and therapist. By allowing her to take charge of the sexual aspect for a while, the pressure can be alleviated and she can focus on understanding what hampers regular sexual intimacy in your relationship. If you approach this as supporting your wife during a crisis, regardless of resolution, it can help you manage your own emotions.\n\nPressuring her to engage in sex may drive her further away. Has the couple's therapist helped you understand the dynamics of your relationship? Has your partner identified any specific needs that are unfulfilled? A good approach is to reciprocate her desires rather than solely focusing on sex.\n\nIt's appropriate to express to her that you cannot sustain a relationship with such limited intimacy. You need her to be honest about what she wants sexually. If that's all she wants, you're uncertain if you can accept it. However, if she desires a more fulfilling sexual connection, she needs to address the obstacles she faces. Give her some time, offer assistance, and reevaluate the situation. Observe if she seeks help to address her own issues.\n\nFrom there, you will have to make a decision. I encourage you to look at the bigger picture, not just the physical aspect, when making your choice."}]}

Hmmm... Is it that you don't fight because you don't bring up what's bothering you? Are you avoiding conflict? Many people do. What do you fear would happen if you let him know how you feel about his recent pulling away? As an engaged couple, now is a really good time to see what happens when you bring a concern to your fiance. Better to find out now what happens when you rock the boat by being real. Or maybe you have spoken to him about it. If so, what happens? Does he listen and help you understand him better? Or does he avoid and reassure you... or maybe dismiss you? This is really important data to gather about how your fiance handles conflict and how you work together. He says \"leave me alone\". That's a pretty bold statement about what he wants. He doesn't seem to have the same idea that you do about what marriage is, and how close you want to be. Plus, I have to say, those words sound more like what a closed-off fourteen-year-old would say to a parent than a loving fiance to his bride to be. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, it could be that your fiance is scared about getting married and this is a temporary reaction that will change. But if this is true, he needs to tell you that so you can understand. So, I suggest that the fact that when you're together you're \"okay\" is perhaps not the best barometer for how you're doing as a couple. Listen to your gut. I encourage you to be really open with your fiance about what your feelings and fears are. This may get rockier before it gets better, but until you face what's not working, you won't know who you truly are as a couple. When you're engaged, it's a really cool time to see a therapist too... to get some conflict resolution skills down before you're a married couple."}]}

You might feel that by working and earning money, you're showing love, but if your partner values quality time, you're missing the mark because you're not spending enough time together. The five languages are words, quality time, acts of service, gifts, and touch. I recommend couples to read this book together and figure out their love languages. Then, start asking for the kind of love you want and make an effort to speak your partner's language. You may never become fluent, but you can improve. The most important part is to understand each other better and know that neither of you is wrong, you just have different ways of expressing love. You can help your boyfriend be specific about how he wants to be loved. He probably just needs you to understand and meet his needs."}]}

What strikes me in your question is that you describe several ways in which your spouse is hurtful, abusive, and controlling with you, and then you ask, \"Should we call it quits?\". I wonder if maybe the first step is for you to start seeing this decision as yours, rather than jointly. The way your spouse treats you is not your fault, Texas. Your lies are a natural and normal way of avoiding situations and encounters that feel unsafe for you. The problem is not your lying. The problem is that you don't feel safe enough to be honest with a person you're supposed to be able to trust.\n\nThere's an analogy that I sometimes use. I don't know if this is scientifically true or simply a useful story, but it's powerful either way, so I will share it with you. If you take a frog and drop it into a pot of boiling water, the frog will jump out immediately, knowing instinctively that if it stays in the pot, it will die. If you take a frog, however, and put it in a pot of cold water, and slowly, slowly heat it to boiling, the frog will boil to death because it will fail to recognize the moment when it no longer has the energy to jump out of the pot. By the time it realizes it's dying, it has lost its strength. It's called \"learned helplessness\". When your power or your voice has been taken away for a long time, you become accustomed to that, and you fail to see the options that are available to you.\n\nYou have a young child, and you may believe that staying in the marriage is best for the child.

However, I do acknowledge that there are decisions for you to make that can lead to a happy life for you and your child.\n\nI sincerely hope you seek professional help, either from a shelter for abused individuals or a therapist.

It burrows into your head. Let's figure this out. First, has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them? Have they cheated before? If not, then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence. If it's a \"yes\", then it's natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need. \"When you refuse to let me see your phone I worry that you're hiding something. I need openness\". If they haven't cheated on you in the past, there are three possible scenarios here. I invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on. What is the specific thing that's triggering your fears? When you have your data recorded, read on...\n\nThe first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and you've developed fears that you will be hurt again or that you're not enough to keep someone interested. This is just fear...people cheat for their own reasons, not because we're not interesting. This may be true if what you wrote down is \"They didn't really do anything wrong...there is no evidence. I'm just scared and suspicious\". That's a cue to do some self-reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like \"nothing has really happened. I can trust.\"\n\nIf what you wrote down was vague evidence, like for example your partner has been distant or irritable, or you're having less sex than usual, you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions. Trust your gut, but your gut isn't seeing evidence of cheating...it's evidence of \"something\". Ask your partner what's up without accusations or assumptions.\n\nThe third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating. Maybe there are texts on a phone, or someone has told you something they saw. I'd say when there is some evidence, it's okay to present this to your partner and ask what's going on. If this happens repeatedly, and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that don't make sense, then it's okay to do a bit of \"research\" and be extra aware of what's going on around you.\n\nI hope that helps."}]}

Sexual intimacy is an important part of many people's lives, but how much importance is placed on it varies from couple to couple. \n\nThe first step would be to have an open conversation with your partner. It's important you are both open about what you desire from sexual intimacy and how much intimacy each one of you wants. For example, asking your partner how often they want to engage in sexual activity per week or month. When having this conversation, it's important that you are both respectful and open with each other. The point of the conversation is to get to know each other and not to solve a problem just yet. \n\nThere are couples who enjoy fulfilling platonic friendship relationships with minimal or no sex because both partners are not interested in it. If you are both on the same page, the lack of sexual activity might not be a problem. \n\nIf there is a difference in your sex drive and frequency of desire, I would recommend seeing a professional relationship and sex therapist as a couple to help you explore your current sexual dynamic, what's contributing to it, what's hindering your sexual connection, and to assist you and your partner in finding creative solutions."}]}

Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?\n(Anxiety Counseling Fundamentals )"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there, thank you for your question. It's absolutely okay to feel nervous about going to therapy. I have experienced anxiety when seeing my own therapist. There can be a few reasons why you might feel this way.\n\nFirst, it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger. You mentioned that it has only been a couple of sessions. Your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and become more comfortable with them.\n\nAnother reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things. As children, we might have had bad experiences opening up to others. Someone might have bullied or ridiculed us, and that experience can stay with us for a long time, making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others. If this is the case, as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapist, this anxiety will subside with time, and you will relearn that it is safe to share.\n\nAnd the last reason why you might feel anxious is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult.\n\nRegardless of the reason, it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist. Having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and build greater trust with them."}]}

Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out. How can I stop these thoughts?\n(Behavioral Change)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there, I first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal. Studies have been done that show that 80% of human thoughts are \"negative,\" so you are not alone. I like to think of thoughts as a tornado... if you are in a tornado, you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial. However, when you are, let's say, a mile away from a tornado, it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as seeking shelter or ensuring the safety of your family and friends.\n\nWhen unhelpful or scary thoughts arise, we tend to start a \"war\" with them, which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado. This makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them. So the question I imagine you have is \"how do I get out of the tornado?\" There are 3 steps to doing this:\n\n1. Get distance from your thoughts by adding \"I am noticing I'm having the thought that....\" to the front of them. For example, \"I am noticing I am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me.\" The purpose of this is not to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought. These thoughts might always be there, and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works, so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy. The purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you don't get swept away by them. You can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky, and often the same thought will come back again and again, but that's okay... just continue to notice it with curiosity. I imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you, so if you can get a little bit of distance, you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you.\n\n2. Tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely. Then breathe into them and make room for them. Our 5 main emotions are joy, sadness, fear/anxiety, shame, and anger. ALL of these emotions are part of being human, and there is no escaping them. So again, struggling with them ends up intensifying them. Instead, let them be and make a little bit of room for them. Often a side effect of this is the intensity will decrease, but it might not. The purpose is to keep them from becoming more intense.\n\n3. Connect with the present moment. Notice what is happening here and now. One way of doing this is tuning into the five senses. What are some things you hear, see, taste, smell, and feel? Another way is to notice what is happening in your body without trying to change it. How deep are your breaths, what is happening with your heart rate, are you feeling cold/warm, etc?\n\nImplementing these three steps can help you refrain from getting caught up in your unhelpful thoughts. Unfortunately, there is no way to get rid of thoughts or feelings completely. So the only option that works in the long run is to accept them while continuing to do what matters to you and what is fulfilling to you.\n\nI hope this helps."}]}

Being 15 years old can be a very difficult time in your teenage life. I remember when I was 15 and how I often felt my parents weren't listening to me. It's even more difficult when you feel that you do not have a friend that you can confide in. Having depression in the past and being able to get through it shows me that you can get through anything. Depression alone is a very difficult problem to work through. In addition to the communication problem with your parents, it appears that you are also struggling with stress and anxiety. We all have stress and anxiety in our lives. If we didn't, none of us would be living. Anxiety and stress keep us on our toes. Often, I have to remind myself of this as well. However, it is how we manage stress and anxiety, so it will not overcome our lives. Are you familiar with relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation or yoga? Relaxation techniques can help you tremendously in reducing your stress and anxiety. Deep breathing exercises are helpful when you are on the go, such as school, shopping, out with friends or whatever extracurricular activities you engage in. Most people do not take full advantage of their lung capacity. I know, that sounds silly. But, it's true. You would be surprised how much air your lungs can hold. Imagine being in the doctor's office and taking deep breaths. This is what you want to do when you are feeling overwhelmed and/or stressed. Take a moment to take in at least 10 deep breaths and let them out slowly. You will be surprised how well you feel afterward. Meditation and yoga are also healthy forms of working through stress and anxiety. You will need a quiet place for your meditation. You want to be in the moment and take in the peace and serenity. All it takes is a quiet place, closing your eyes and thinking of your happy place. Some people use meditation music as well. If you have access to this type of music and/or the internet for more ways to practice meditation, please go for it. Yoga, on the other hand, will take a little more work and practice. I would not suggest you learn this on your own if you have never attempted yoga before. Find an experienced yoga instructor to teach you the ropes and/or ask your school counselor about the possibility of getting someone to come to the school to teach the students. Lastly, in regards to your parents, it is very important to be able to have a relationship where you feel comfortable communicating. I would recommend writing a letter to them if you are unable to express how you feel in person. A letter is more intimate and requires a little more effort on their end. If they are open to working on this relationship, maybe suggest family counseling to fully work on this issue. I hope this was helpful for you, and I wish you the best."}]}

How can I fix my underlying issues?\n(Behavioral Change Social Relationships)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there. It's great that you are able to recognize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive. At the root of it is fear. Fear of losing someone, fear of being alone, fear of not being good enough. All those fears can lead to low self-esteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you don't lose them. The thing is, controlling other people only pushes them away. It's a vicious circle, right? What I would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking. You can start with this assignment. Write down all the things you think about yourself, positive and not-so-positive. Then rewrite those not-so-positive things so they are positive. For example, thinking something like, \"I'm too pushy,\" can be rewritten as, \"I'm assertive and I go after what I want.\" It can be hard to do since we tend to get \"stuck\" in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves. If you have someone you trust, you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself. Finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further, but if that's not an option for you right now, there are lots of self-help books and websites out there. You've already taken the first step, so keep moving forward."}]}

I want you to know that I am here to assist you in any way that I can. Firstly, you did not mention whether or not you have children with this person. I'm going to assume that you do. So, the most important thing right now is to ask yourself if you and your children are safe. Is the person currently living with you or are they coming and going? If they are coming and going or currently living with you, my suggestion is for you to pack a bag for yourself and your children and go somewhere safe, like a family member's home, a friend's place, or a shelter temporarily. I cannot stress this enough. Although some people tend to downplay their abusers' behavior, such as claiming that they only do it when they are drunk or angry, it is those individuals who find themselves or their children in serious situations. Therefore, you can never take physical or mental abuse lightly, as you never know what may be going through that person's mind at that particular time. It's always better to be safe than sorry. Secondly, it will not be safe, helpful, or productive to attempt to talk to the abuser about your relationship. Abusers often try to manipulate you into staying by apologizing or trying to justify their actions. This is when you should go see a magistrate in order to obtain a protective order for yourself and your children. It's unfortunate that your partner was involved with someone else and caused a pregnancy, however, that is no longer your concern. Your priority at this point is to keep yourself and your children safe. I would also suggest counseling for you and your children to work through these issues. I hope this was helpful, and please stay safe and take care of yourself."}]}

It's difficult when you want to express to your father how he's hurting you but you don't feel safe enough to do so. Your reaction is understandable. It is the responsibility of a parent to create a safe environment for their child to be open, but unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case for your dad. Waiting for him to change might not be very helpful. You cannot change your dad, but there are things you can do for yourself and your relationship with him.\n\nWhile it's understandable that you're avoiding him, have you considered the impact it might have on your dad? He might be feeling frustrated, rejected, and punished by your withdrawal. Although you think he knows that you're hurt, he probably doesn't. So, it's like a never-ending cycle. Your dad's rudeness leads to your silence, which makes him feel abandoned and frustrated. Consequently, his frustration manifests as more rudeness, causing you to withdraw further, and the cycle repeats itself. While you may not be able to change his part in this cycle, you can certainly change your own.\n\nAre you willing to take a risk? Can you be honest about how you feel? What's the worst thing that could happen if you said to your dad, \"You know why I avoid you? I stay silent because when I talk to you, you say rude things. So, if you want me to talk, I need to know you can listen.\" I imagine that it would be different in your own words, given the generational gap between us. \n\nI don't know the extent of your dad's rudeness. If he is abusive, then seeking therapy alone or talking to someone about it might be a better plan. I don't want to put you at risk. However, if you feel that your dad won't harm you, maybe giving honesty a try is worth considering.\n\nMy point is, as rude as your dad may be, avoiding a relationship by staying silent is also rude. Your silence is powerful. Your dad cannot read your mind, and if you want things to improve, you'll need to engage in a conversation with him.\n\nAnd, if both of you are open to it, seeking therapy together can be extremely beneficial."}]}

Throughout the entire first day that we met, he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. That same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house without my mom's acknowledgment and we kissed. The next two days were a repetition of the first day. On the third night, my mother finally caught us, and I was kicked out of my house. I left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. It was very hard for us. His stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had. I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot. Our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. After that, it was a downward spiral. We were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. We kept having the famous \"you're doing it wrongdo it this way\" argument. After six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started. One afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. I was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. He told me to let him leave or he would hit me. He had once promised he would never touch me, so I challenged him to do it. He slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. I haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now. I don't live with him, I don't depend on him, and we don't have children. We both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. He always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change.

I've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me. I know he has to change that on his own.

I don't deny them a relationship with their dad, but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core.

You have a long list of complaints about your boyfriend. It sounds like he's maybe a bit immature and moody, and these things affect you, for sure. I get it. It's got me curious, and if I was working with you, I'd want to know a lot more about how long you've been together and what's actually working well between you two. I would also ask a lot of questions about the details of your description. What tells you he's 'sneaky'? Does he lie? How do you know he lies to you? Also, are you wanting to make things better with him, do you just want an ear to vent to, are you looking for validation, or do you hope someone will help you wake up to an unhappy situation? It helps me if I know what you want.\n\nWhenever I meet someone who has a lot of complaints about their partner or boyfriend, I encourage them first to look at the language they're using. Some of your words tell me that you think you know what he's thinking that he wants to fight so he can leave, that he thinks he's perfect. It's always tricky when we assume what someone's thinking, and in an argument or dialogue, these kinds of statements tend to lead to defensiveness and an escalated argument. I'd encourage you to focus on his actual behaviors and how they affect you, rather than the motives or beliefs you think are behind the behaviors because you really can't know what he's thinking unless he tells you. As a general rule, the \"When you do X, I feel Y\" sentence goes far in helping others understand what we feel.\n\nSo, it's fair to say \"when you lie to me, I can't trust you\", or \"when you end our date early to hang with your friends I feel like I'm not important to you\", or \"your mood swings are difficult for me\", or \"I don't seem to get apologies from you\". Try to focus on his actual behavior when you talk to him about this stuff. A relationship counselor can help you each understand the other better beyond the surface behaviors if you want to improve the relationship.\n\nThat said, I have to ask...if you haven't been with Mr. Not So Great for very long, is it maybe time to rethink the relationship? Unless there is a balance of really loving and positive behaviors that you're leaving out, you don't seem happy. A good therapist can help you understand why you are stuck in an unhappy relationship, if that is what's happening.\n\nThere's a lot to sort out here...how to communicate about your needs, how to know when to call it quits if something doesn't feel good... I wish you the best as you continue to examine these questions with assistance from friends or professionals."}]}

I'm sorry to hear that this was your first experience in 25 years with feeling in love. You deserve better. My understanding of today's social cultural norms is that it is somehow acceptable to abruptly stop communicating with someone you've been seeing, without explanation. I don't get it. It's rude. You're better off without this person around. There are still people who operate with respect, but this person isn't one of them.\n\nIf I'm reading this right, you knew this person for a week? In my humble opinion, much heartache and many poor relationships come from attaching too soon. It takes years to get to know someone deeply. I know it's hard to keep yourself from falling in love, but you owe it to your heart to take these things more slowly, because everyone puts their best self forward at the beginning and it takes time for that to relax and for you to see who they are when times are tougher and real stuff happens.\n\nIf I was your therapist, I'd be curious about how this is the first time you've fallen in love? Or is it that you were in love 25 years ago? Was your heart broken then, or did something encourage your heart to close? What has kept you from either meeting people or letting yourself fall in love until now? Is there a danger that you will decide love isn't worth the risk?

How do I move on?\n(Relationship Dissolution )"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, breakups can be very devastating and even traumatic. Recovering from one is a process that is unique for every person and will take time. It's important that you don't compare yourself to others. Each and every person will experience this grieving process differently. Here are a few tips to help with your recovery:\n\n1. Make sure you surround yourself with people who love and support you, friends and family. Even though you might feel like being alone, make an effort to be around them.\n\n2. Although you might not feel like it, try to take care of yourself as much as possible. Eat healthily, get regular sleep, and engage in vigorous or gentle exercise depending on your mood. The last thing that we want to do when we are physically sick, e.g., flu, is to take care of ourselves, even though that's what we need the most. But when we do get that chicken broth, sleep, and vitamins, we recover much faster and with less discomfort. That's exactly the same when it comes to emotional pain. Take care of yourself, keep yourself strong and healthy so you can recover faster.\n\n3. As much as possible, put away reminders of the relationship. You might not be ready to throw things out, but try to put them away in a box in storage or in a closet. And also block social media reminders. There is a lot of wisdom in the saying \"Out of sight, out of mind.\"\n\n4. Once the initial shock and intensity of the breakup wear off, try out something new. In a relationship, we often forget and give up on things that we always wanted to do or try. Now it's time to bring out that dusty bucket list and start trying something new.\n\n5. If possible, change your scenery by going away on vacation with a friend or even by yourself. Changing your surroundings can really help you change your thoughts, mindset, and forget your ex, even if just for a few hours. Even a weekend getaway with a couple of girlfriends can do wonders.\n\n6. In addition, to help you make sense of your past relationship and what went wrong, I would highly recommend seeing a professional counselor or therapist."}]}

The psychological or mental cravings are usually based on habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you're consciously trying to quit, you'll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if I'm on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I'll give in and eat it.\n\nYou're going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That's normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That's what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it, \"Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now,\" but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.\n\nI've suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they're going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.\n\nBest of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby."}]}

I appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation. I agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children. Children need adults around them to act maturely, cooperatively, and peacefully even when they don't like each other. It helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing. Your ex-boyfriend seems more focused on his own needs. In fact, he demonstrates behaviors that are aggressive, controlling, and manipulative, bordering on parental alienation. I agree this is a problem.\n\nI also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy. It's not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress. Honor this instinct you have.\n\nI will suggest a few things to you. First, to gather support around you, professionally if you need it, from family and friends, and certainly from your husband. If you two are on the same page regarding the children's issues and your ex, that will help. He can help run interference when it comes to his daughter. It will help you feel supported.\n\nKnow that your ex's behaviors aren't happening because you did anything wrong. It's the way he operates, and maybe this is why you're not with him? You can't change him, but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression. You're correct that he will always be there, and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situation.\n\nKeep on defining clear boundaries. You might sound like a broken record \"You'll have to talk to my husband about that\", but that's okay. It's okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle. It's okay to not respond to texts or other communications that aren't vitally important. It's okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable. It's okay to not engage with him more than is necessary.\n\nRegarding his manipulative behaviors that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you, I recommend you document these behaviors and incidents carefully and fully. Let him know what your expectations are, simply and clearly and in writing \"our agreement states X, and you are not following our agreement\". Your daughter doesn't have to be aware, I think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflict.\n\nA professional therapist can help you with all of this. I hope this helps get you started towards greater peace, at least within yourself."}]}

Lean into it. It's okay because there are many things he does have power over, and that's where he can focus. He has the power to give his children a happy dad. That's HUGE. That's why he left, I'd guess. I bet the main barrier to him being happy is the guilt he feels. That's his ex's voice... that's what she wants him to feel... to give into that is letting her win. Ending a marriage in order to be happy is his right. He has not intentionally harmed his children. Hopefully he's aware that the separation has affected them and he's working to create peace and balance in their lives, but he's can let go of the shame she wants him to feel it's crippling him. He has the power to separate emotionally from his ex. He's not doing that when he lets her words control his emotions. He's still reacting to her. He hasn't completely left yet.

Try to view the situation from the perspective of everyone, including yourself, who is involved in this significant change. Perhaps having a family dialogue about acceptance and readiness to embrace a new partner for your parent could foster empathy among all family members."}]}

Is this what your partner told you or are you feeling this way about yourself? The difference is that what you'd like from a relationship may be very reasonable, only that your partner is not someone who wants to meet your needs. One way of evaluating whether you're actually needy is whether you feel that you give yourself love, take good care of yourself when you're in situations that are not connected to being part of a couple. If being by yourself feels uneasy most of the time, then probably practicing self-love, consciously treating yourself with consideration and thoughtfulness, may help you feel less needy of others. This way, when you're with a partner, the time together will be in enjoying the partner, not getting love because of not figuring out a way of giving love to yourself."}]}

Hopefully, your spouse has been very regretful and upfront and honest with you since this happened. It may take a while to rebuild your trust with them, and they should understand this. It's also very important to discuss WHY they cheated. You want to make sure that the reasons behind this were not something that could happen again in the future. And if it can, there needs to be an action plan in place, like being honest with how they're feeling, so that both of you can work to fix the situation.\n\nIf the cheating has happened more than once, you may want to reconsider your decision to stay in the marriage. It would be apparent that they did not truly regret what they had done, otherwise they wouldn't repeat the same mistake. However, if it was a single event and they have shown you and continue to show you that they genuinely love you and are sorry for their mistake, I would give it a try. People do make mistakes and sometimes it takes an event like this to realize what you have.\n\nKnow that it takes time and that you have the right to feel what you feel.

Questioning mainstream thinking and being in touch with your own views are signs of strength and clarity in a person. As a therapist, I always advise my patients to avoid antidepressants. Their effectiveness lies in suppressing a person's mood and feelings. If someone does not know how they are feeling, then they will have more difficulty in understanding themselves, their uncertainties and hesitations, and overall, how they relate to others and what they expect from others. Antidepressants mask how someone feels. In a crisis, temporarily taking antidepressants may be helpful. If someone is so overwhelmed that they are not functioning, then suppressing unhappy feelings so that the person can get through a day may be of benefit for a short while. Basically, respect and follow your own opinion about antidepressants. Your view is shared by many. It is a minority opinion, and very valid. If you would like to shop for a therapist, ask the person on the phone what their opinions are about antidepressants.

For example, if he is willing to talk to you about what he does on a daily basis and or what he would like to be doing, you may be able to get a sense of what he finds difficult and find some resources to help.

In other words, if you do decide to give him another chance, what would you do differently? Not saying that you are to blame or the cause of the negative words AT ALL, but don't allow such disrespect from him or anyone else in the future. If you do decide to give it another try, go in with a voice, with the demand of respect, with your needs and wants expressed and expected. With an increase in your self-worth and confidence, you will know what to do if his actions are true or if with dishonest intentions. Seek counseling as well if you need that additional support to find self."}]}

When parents get divorced, they still need to figure out how to have a relationship so that they can parent their child. We might divorce our partners; however, we don't divorce our children. If anything, our children need to know that we are still a stable force in their lives. Unfortunately, in some relationships, children get used as a bargaining piece and I am hearing that may be happening in your relationship. You can move on from the relationship with your ex while still maintaining a relationship with your child. It is possible and it takes both parents to agree to do the right thing by their child. It is important for your children to have some consistency in their time with you. For example, if you and your ex don't have a parenting schedule, it is something that you want to create so that you can not only decide for yourself when you will see your child, but your child can know when you will be available just for them. This will lay the foundation for consistency and allow your child to have some security in troubled times. I would highly recommend you sit down with your ex and discuss how you can both be a positive source in your child's life. How you can both be there to help raise them. If this is not a conversation that you can have on your own, you might seek out help from the court. There are parenting experts and mediators who might be able to assist you. Remember, in any discussion, keep the focus on what is best for your child and you will be moving in the right direction. Best of luck to you."}]}

Divorce can have a significant impact on a child's life. In order for me to provide appropriate advice or suggestions, I would need more information about your situation. There are many factors to consider, and without knowing the whole story, any advice given could potentially worsen your situation.\n\nHowever, there are a few positive aspects that I can see. Firstly, you mentioned that you have a therapist, which is great. I hope you can discuss this matter with them soon. While they may not be able to offer legal advice, they can assist you in dealing with the situation in accordance with the law. If you cannot change the circumstances, it is important to learn how to cope with them better.\n\nSecondly, as you are 17, you will legally be considered an adult at the age of 18. This means you will not be bound by any custody or visitation arrangements that are currently in place.\n\nTeenagers usually have a significant say in custody arrangements when it comes to court proceedings. However, since you did not provide specific details about your situation, I am unsure of the exact circumstances. Were your parents ever married? Are they currently separated or divorced? Was there a court hearing regarding custody? Not all couples have an official court-ordered arrangement, as every family is unique. Was there any history of abuse between your parents or towards you? Do either of your parents have addiction issues, major health concerns, or mental health issues? Additionally, you mentioned wanting to live with your mom but did not explain why. Are you hesitant to express your desire to stay with her to your dad? Is one parent more lenient and fun while the other is stricter, or is there something else happening? The decision regarding custody should not solely rest on you, and others should not make it on your behalf without considering your input. It is essential to seek advice from those who have a better understanding of your situation so they can recommend the best course of action for you.\n\nWhatever you decide, remember to stay strong. Before you know it, you will reach the age of 18. Focus on the freedom and opportunities that lie ahead, such as college and planning for your future. Take control of your own life and strive to make it the best it can be. Don't let anxiety and depression cloud your judgment and lead you to irreversible actions."}]}

Therapy should be a healthy and positive experience of growth. You have the right to seek certain qualities in a therapist and find the right one. Each therapist is bound by a code of ethics, and clients should have high expectations. You trust them to guide, support, and help you achieve the best outcome and success. You should never be or feel judged, but rather feel comfortable with the therapy process moving along according to your goals.\n\nAs a therapist, I encourage my clients to always express their feelings, even if they disagree with me. They also have the right to inform me if something I'm doing is not working for them. Communication is critical in maintaining a healthy therapeutic alliance and relationship. I can offer new ways of thinking and strategies that my clients may not have considered. Listening to my clients is important. Clients should also feel safe, non-judgmental, and confident when sharing in a therapeutic environment.\n\nRemember, you are in control of your healing process. Speak your thoughts openly. My advice is to look for a therapist who is open to hearing how you feel, even if it's about them. They should be open to feedback. It will take time to rebuild trust, but remember to ask questions and communicate with the next therapist about your experience and how it made you feel. Trust and respectful communication are crucial for your well-being. Be honest and clearly state your expectations from the start.\n\nI offer free 50-minute first sessions for clients. The reason I do this is to provide clients with an opportunity to observe the environment, ask questions, and determine their comfort level while deciding if it's a good fit. Other therapists may offer similar opportunities, so try finding one who is willing to provide a consultation. This could help you gauge the situation and establish expectations.\n\nThe article below is an excellent resource that discusses what to look for in a therapist. It is worth your time because you deserve to find the best help available. The article is based on evidence from research and clinical experience.

There is no set time for grief to be over, but if it has been three years and you are still crying every day, then this is beyond normal grief. I do not know your age or your situation with school or work, but I would imagine that if you were truly crying all day, every day, someone would have noticed and sought help for you. For one thing, bills have to be paid.\n\nThere are typically five stages of grief and they can occur in any order. You can also go back to a stage that you previously experienced. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance are these stages. At first, people usually deny the fact that they have lost someone or that they are losing someone. This may mean denying their illness or denying their death. Then comes bargaining, when you may beg for their return in exchange for anything. Depression occurs when the reality sinks in and we cry and truly feel the loss. It seems like you are stuck in this phase.\n\nFinally, acceptance is when we acknowledge that it has happened and we gradually move on with our lives. When we lose someone, we never forget them. We may have tough days, such as holidays or special occasions that remind us of our loved ones. But we reach a point where we accept that death is part of life, it is inevitable, and life goes on.\n\nA therapist can help you understand the reasons for your prolonged grief and provide coping mechanisms to better deal with it. One suggestion I have is to not suppress your sad feelings. Instead, embrace them. Let the feelings wash over you and accept them. Trying to avoid feeling something will not help. Sadness is a natural part of life and should be experienced just like happiness. Unpleasant feelings should not be avoided.\n\nI am sincerely sorry that you have experienced such a difficult time for three years. You deserve happiness and a fulfilling life. I am certain that your loved one would not want you to be sad for so long. I wish you all the best as you continue to heal from this loss and manage your grief."}]}

The first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sister's house everything changed. That's when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again. Then she told me to come to her in Missouri. So that's what I did. I quit my job I dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her. Once I got there everything was fine again. She apologized for everything and said she didn't mean any of it then we were good for about a week. Then she went back to saying she didn't love me anymore and had no feelings for me.

I wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled? Some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant, and all this does is bring up more problems. You say you never treated her badly, and I believe you. People in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on. In fact, giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a self outside of this relationship can be unhealthy. It takes two whole, healthy, happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole, healthy, happy couple in a relationship.

One thing I wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or is this something that he asked about? In the future, it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this. I think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history. For one thing, it is a good idea to be checked for STDs before entering into a sexual relationship with someone, and it is fair to share that information with each other. Partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you don't like to do. This gets into a gray area for some people. I don't necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and I certainly don't want a whole lot of details. Sometimes that is an image I just don't want in my head about my partner. Vague details are usually enough. However, I understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past. This is a reflection on him, not you. This shows insecurities on his part. You cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information. The past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future. If he can't handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship. You can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you. I have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity. It takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though. If your boyfriend can't get over your past, you may have to let him go. Don't keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you. Constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low self-esteem due to this type of treatment. I don't see that you have done anything wrong. If you aren't cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly, how he handles that information is on him. Ultimately, relationships have a tendency to come and go. Don't fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you. It is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be.

If not, I would advise that you do so sooner than later so that you can learn what is causing you to be unmotivated and causing difficulty with breaking the cycle that you are in. It is also a good idea to get a medical evaluation from your doctor to rule out any medical causes for your current condition. Most often, difficult situations that life throws at us, along with an inability to think positively, and break bad habits are what cause depression. Some things you can do immediately are seek help from a professional, schedule in time every day to engage in pleasurable or once pleasurable activities, exercise daily, and practice thinking more positively. Set a few daily goals for yourself and write them down each morning or the night before. Achieving your goals every day will give you a sense of accomplishment and can lead to feeling more optimistic and capable. Additionally, keep a journal to write down how you are feeling and what ideas you have to help feel better. Sometimes having these ideas written down make it more real and tangible. Know that depression is most often curable but takes work and a desire to change which you clearly have. Once you start feeling better about yourself and your life, your grades should naturally begin to improve, as you will have more motivation and energy to focus on that particular area.

This tells me that you didn't have the strength to leave him on your own despite the fact that you say he was emotionally and mentally abusive and also cheating on you. Low self-esteem can keep someone in a bad relationship because they think they can't do any better. Also, abusers will make you think that they are the best thing you can get.

Take this time alone to work on yourself.\n\nAs hurtful as it may be that other people don't want to help you, this is something that you need to do for yourself without feeling like you need someone in your life to take care of you. Your statement \"I don't feel like I exist anymore\" tells me that in addition to low self-esteem, you also don't have a clear sense of identity and rely on the people in your life to help define who you are. People can and will let you down. It is important for you to learn to handle disappointment, learn to take care of your own needs, and gain a stronger sense of self.\n\nDo nice things for yourself every day because you deserve it. Even if it is just to soak a little longer in a hot bubble bath, do something that makes you feel good. Find a hobby that you enjoy. Look in the mirror and tell yourself some positive affirmations daily. Search for positive affirmations online to find some that resonate with you. Such statements might be \"I am a good person who deserves to be happy\" or \"I can do this.\" Some relaxation and meditation exercises may help you as well. There are free meditation exercises available online.\n\nTake this time to focus on yourself and try not to worry about what everyone else in your life is doing. When you are a happier, more stable person, the right people will come into your life without you even looking for them. Good luck with rebuilding your life. I know it is hard.

It is normal for both of you to have a range of emotions, including hope, despair, fear, anger, and gratitude. Please remember that there is no right or wrong way to feel, and the emotional journey may not follow a specific pattern for either of you. Instead of assuming his feelings, I encourage you to ask him directly how he is doing today. Repeatedly asking \"How are you doing today?\" will show your love and compassion for him. In case he struggles to communicate, you can share your observations by saying, \"I have noticed that you seem more withdrawn, and this worries me.\" It will certainly be helpful for you to understand his thoughts and emotions, especially considering that he concealed his intention to harm himself. It is natural for you to want to know. If depression and hopelessness are present, it is likely that these factors contributed to his initial despair. Remember that assistance is available. Depression can be treated, and it is crucial to seek treatment during this vulnerable period. This complex situation may greatly benefit from the guidance of a qualified therapist who can help both of you understand and manage your emotions. Regardless of whether your spouse seeks help, I encourage you to seek support for yourself as well."}]}

Have you considered a date night or anything that doesn't have to cost a lot of money, but could make each of you feel special? Something else you could try is to consider talking to each other in a way where you summarize what you are hearing and reflect back to make sure that you got it right, rather than just assuming so. Communicating this way can feel awkward at times, but it could reconnect how you are listening and deeply connecting with your partner. Also, you may discover that you are on two different pages about things on which you thought you understood what each other felt, wanted, or desired. Consider what makes your partner feel loved, valued, appreciated, or special. Can you name a few things and get them right according to your partner when you check in? Can he do the same for you? You could also try doing two things every day that would be appreciated by your partner without either of you having to ask for it. There is some more information here, although what you do for one another does not necessarily need to be on this list. Reconnecting is a bit of a process. Try to praise yourself and your partner for the attempts that you make and recognize that you're not going to get it right 100% of the time. You may also find this book to be helpful or there are other similar ones by the same author. If this still seems difficult, consider seeing a local mental health professional. As one more thought, recall that this relationship involves both of you. If you are both committing to change your level of connection, change will likely not be a steady uphill climb.

It all started when I was being bullied in high school. In ninth grade, my principal told me I needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. I needed professional help for my stress because I was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. After that, I was fine for a couple of years. I entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. I believe my depression rebooted from there with the stress. I began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. Obviously, that wasn't the right choice. I regret ever doing that, seeing as even though I'm not selfharming anymore, I always look back at that time whenever I feel very stressed. I have a big problem with handling problems in life. Whenever a problem arises, I get stressed and I feel hopeless, as if it's not going to get better. I get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot especially when talking to others, which then leads to depression.

Often, when individuals face this concern, there is a tendency to prioritize pleasing others. When we strive to make others happy without understanding the proper \"rules for success\", even simple tasks can become overwhelming.\n\nStress management involves dealing with our own anxieties regarding others' needs, our abilities, and the pressure of multiple demands. Each aspect requires different strategies to handle effectively. For instance, assertiveness communication training may help you manage colleagues' expectations and deadlines, but it may not address your personal anxieties. To find a solution, try separating the different aspects of the problem and working on them individually.\n\nKeeping a journal might help you understand why stress overwhelms you easily and identify unhelpful responses. For example, does a certain person's communication style consistently make you feel undervalued, leading you to prioritize their requests? Do you experience a decline in productivity at a specific time of day, coinciding with an increase in requirements?\n\nAsk yourself these challenging questions and see where they lead you."}]}

I don't know whether it is about sex itself or about ideas of worthiness or feeling desirable. There is also a difference between having self-doubt about the actual physicality of having sex - performance-related or having doubts about whether you want to have sex with a particular person. Having sex can lead to feelings of great vulnerability. If your partner is someone you trust, consider discussing what it is that comes up for you around the issue of sex. This is certain things that your partner would be willing to do that can ease your discomfort, like staying with you for some time before and after sexual interactions. Another idea to consider is spending time with your partner and using non-sexual touch for each other, perhaps first you to him and then him to you, and communicating very clearly about what you like and do not like. Some people like to be spoken to during physical touch and other people do not. All of this can be part of your discussions. When you feel comfortable with that, you could move into sexual touch in this manner and actually look at what you do and do not like. You may also consider discussing things that are totally off-limits for you all the time and things for which you would like warning or awareness before they happen. There are really a number of different ways to work on becoming more comfortable if you trust your partner and if your concern is about sex itself. If this feels pretty structured, it is initially. Generally, the idea is to learn more about each other and yourselves and then the process becomes much more natural. If the concern relates more to self-esteem related sex, consider asking your partner to list several things that he or she likes about you. Even if you don't necessarily see yourself in the same light, consider that this is how your partner sees you, so these are some of the things that make you attractive to them, perhaps both in sexual ways and in a wider discussion of the relationship.

When you said that you are jaded, I'm not sure whether you mean that you are jaded toward someone, something, life in general, or some combination thereof. One of the difficult things about anxiety is that anxiety can lead to more anxiety because of being concerned about having another panic attack. Consider remembering that panic attacks usually only last a few minutes and the reason they don't go away right away is because of the way your brain releases chemicals because some part of your brain is reacting as if you are in danger in some way. As far as finding yourself, you may consider looking at what parts of each day you can control as a way to stay centered. You could also focus on something that makes you feel happy and or comfortable. You may also consider the list of values here to give yourself an idea of what is most important to you, what it is that you are living by now, and what values you would prefer to live by.

It seems like there are things that you are proud of, which is excellent. I hope that there are also supportive people in your life who acknowledge the positive things you're doing. If you feel that your parent or guardian would be open to accompanying you to a local mental health professional, that might be a good opportunity to have discussions about your relationship. The reason I suggest this is because a mental health professional can sometimes shed light on conflicts that may not be apparent to those involved. If you want to talk to your parent about how they are feeling, perhaps they would be willing to have a conversation with you. If you decide to proceed with this, I suggest the following:\n\n- Ask if this is a good time to have an important conversation. If not, inquire about a better time.\n- Approach the conversation with the goal of spending about five minutes learning more about your parent's perspective. By asking open-ended questions, you can gain a better understanding of their thoughts and emotions.\n- Remember that it's not necessary to agree with them, but it's important to validate their viewpoint.\n- Use questions starting with \"who, what, how, where, when\" as they are easier to answer and tend to minimize emotional intensity.\n- Summarize what you've heard to ensure you've understood correctly.\n- Once you've listened to your parent, express your own thoughts and feelings. It might be helpful to prepare some points in advance so you can articulate yourself effectively.\n- It may be challenging to avoid defensiveness initially, but try to resist the urge to jump into arguments right away. Remind yourself that doing so might hinder understanding your parent's perspective.\n- If your parent declines to have a conversation, respect their decision.\n- If your parent doesn't want to attend counseling with you, keep in mind that you have the option to seek treatment on your own. Depending on your age and location, you may need parental consent, but this isn't always the case. If you need assistance navigating this process, consider reaching out to local mental health agencies for guidance and support."}]}

There's a modern parable about two young brothers. One child is in a room full of every toy you could imagine, and he's miserable the other is in a room full of horse manure, and he's flinging it around with joy. So then someone comes and asks the first boy why he's so miserable, because he has so much. He says that he's missing the one toy that he really wants. Then the brother is asked why he's so happy in a room full of manure, and he says \"With all this sht, there's gotta be a pony in here somewhere\". Happiness is a state of mind, and I hear you saying that you used to be happy, so maybe this means you believe it's possible. That's a wonderful start.\n\nResearch on depression shows us that it is very linked to pessimism. You say \"I always see the worst end of things\". That's pessimism. Life is like an elephant. If all you see is roughness, back up and walk around. The view will change.\n\nThe key to optimism is to build your ability to see the bad things in life as 1. temporary (this will pass). I know how to fix friendships, 2. specific (not involving the whole of your life), and 3. not your fault. Tons of people fail road tests. On the flip side, it helps if we can see good things as 1. more permanent, 2. bleeding into other areas of our lives, and 3. something YOU created. Not taking credit for good things and blaming yourself for the bad ones is typical especially of women.\n\nThe feelings you are having are temporary. You're in a slump, and it's a good time to sit down and look at how you can make the picture look different. I think you know how, but you lack energy right now. If tackling this on your own isn't enough, a therapist can help you take that step back to look at the big picture and help you rebuild your natural resilience and capacity for joy.

It is actually quite common for one partner to have a higher sex drive than the other, and can lead to discord in the relationship. The good news is, there are ways to deal with this. You may have already answered your question. There are many medications that can alter one's sex drive. If your birth control pills are the cause of this, talk to your doctor about switching to a different brand. You may even consider alternate methods for birth control, such as condoms. However, there are some other things to ask yourself. First, you used the term \"affection\" but then talked about sex. They're not the same thing. There are different kinds of intimacy, and many different ways to show love for someone. A book you might find useful is \"The Five Love Languages\". Defining what \"affection\" means to you, and to him, and discovering all the ways you both can show this towards each other, may help lessen some of your anxiety over this. Humans are hardwired to need appropriate physical touch. In fact, studies have shown that newborns/premies who can receive skin-on-skin contact with their parent can recover faster than babies who don't receive this touch. It's called Kangaroo Care. Children who have grown up in neglectful environments where they're not hugged and kissed and shown appropriate physical contact can often be unable to show this to their partners and children when they're adults. One question to ask yourself is, were you having intimacy issues before starting the medication? If so, there may be other, deeper issues at play here. For someone who has received the wrong kind of sexual/physical touch (sexual abuse, physical beatings), it can be difficult to allow someone to be physically close to you. A therapist could help you work through this. Sometimes, a person may lose their sexual feelings for their partner due to issues in the relationship. Once those issues are resolved, the sex drive comes back. Examine your relationship and see if either of you are unhappy, if you've been arguing a lot, or if there are any problems in your relationship that need to be addressed. Finally, look for the other ways that the two of you may be intimate in a nonsexual way. You may be doing things for each other that you don't even realize, and noticing these will help you appreciate it more. Take the stress off of the sexual gratification and focus on showing your love in other ways. Some people like to give gifts, do the other person's chores, or do other things they think the person will appreciate. If, after all of this, you still have a discrepancy with one of you having a higher sex drive, there are many articles online that offer advice for couples dealing with this situation that you may find useful. It is a very common issue for a lot of couples."}]}

I think the first and most important question you need to ask yourself is do you truly believe in your heart that you can forgive him and trust him again? Once you answer that question honestly then you can move in one of two directions. First, if you truly love this guy and see yourself being with him long term and for the \"long haul\", so to speak...and you genuinely want to forgive him and trust him again, that is completely doable and possible if you both put in the work. But, there's a greater issue here that needs to be addressed. You say your relationship is \"good\", but there's been a sexual disconnect between the two of you and that usually indicates some type of emotional disconnect is at the core. Would you agree with that, or what are your thoughts? Were you giving him less sexual attention than you normally do or were you guys never on the same page about sexual needs and having compatible sex drives? If you are more of an emotional person than he is, you may have been less interested sexually because he hasn't been meeting your emotional needs. For instance, if you hadn't been feeling loved, cared about, validated, appreciated, cherished, and special to him than you may have felt less connected physically and been less interested. This is a common issue with couples, and can easily be addressed if the communication in your relationship is strong and you can find a way to express to him your frustrations. In essence, many women tend to have more emotional needs than men, this is the way we are hardwired, and there are exceptions to this of course, but if you have been feeling neglected emotionally than your lack of interest in sex is actually completely understandable and NORMAL Until he understands this, and can learn to tune into your needs emotionally, you may struggle with feeling you are out of sync emotionally and sexually. This leads to you both being frustrated, but if all this is ringing true to you, he seriously probably has no clue what's going on and may not know how you're feeling. You need to communicate your needs to him if you are super lost with how to do that, there's an awesome book called The Five Love Languages. It's not that long, and it's very approachable and easy to apply the concepts to your relationships. Invaluable resource for relationships and truly eye opening really. This is a long post, I'm sorry. But this is such an important issue that is very common and many people feel lost about how to handle it. So back to the second direction you can go. You feel very betrayed, you aren't sure if you can ever trust him again and you see yourself perhaps being paranoid forever and never being able to completely get over this. For instance, if he says he is working late, or if he doesn't call or text right away when he usually does, you may immediately jump to the worst case scenario that he is cheating again. Of course, it may not be true, he may have legit reasons for his behaviors, but the point is if you are going to be in paranoia mode OR you just will always be unsure whether he loves you and is committed to you and only you, then the trust may not be able to be rebuilt. You need to think long and hard about this, and if you decide you have the capacity to forgive him and rebuild your foundation of trust and honesty, then you need to let him know very explicitly what you need him to do to earn that trust back. You can't just tell him vaguely \"I need to trust you again\" if he wants his family back and he's willing to do the work, you need to line out exactly what he needs to do and he needs to do it. But, be prepared that he might throw out there that he cheated because he felt you weren't attracted to him anymore or he tries to put the blame on you somehow because he says you weren't meeting his physical needs. If he throws that out there, but you weren't showing him the affection because you were frustrated emotionally, then it all starts with you communicating that to him. Get that book. In conclusion, if you feel in your heart there is no way you will be able to trust him again and you will always wonder if he's cheating when his behavior isn't spot on, you will be a nervous wreck and perhaps cutting your losses now would spare you the continued heartache. There is certainly a way to work through this, but you both have to be motivated and you have to get to the source of why the cheating happened in the first place. Rebuilding trust can be a long process, maybe even years, and for some people, they may never be able to fully trust and let go of the past.

You are already on the road to a happier life with this realization. A lot of individuals do not recognize that it may be something about them that continues to attract a person like this and will only blame it on the individuals for treating them that way. Until you realize there is a problem you won't start looking for a solution. Don't misunderstand me. The abuse is not your fault. You are seeing a pattern, though, so this does need to be addressed. First, go and buy the book \"Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin\" by Anne Katherine. Read it. This book describes many situations that are similar to yours, describes how a person came to be that way, and how to stop it. You will have to learn to set good boundaries in your life and to maintain them. Be single for a while. Stay single until you feel like a whole, healthy, happy person on your own. Often we get in a relationship because of a need. If you feel like you need a person in your life to make you a whole person then you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons. The first step is to work on whatever it is in you that makes you feel like you need another person in your life. Identify those needs and then learn to fulfill them on your own. I was doing a couples therapy session and the husband was being emotionally abusive to the wife. This was a recurrent theme for her, like you are saying it is for you. However, she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private therapy, and this was a new relationship. Obviously she still had not gotten it right because she did once again attract a person with these tendencies. The difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had become a stronger person. When she looked at him in our session and said to him \"I don't need you. I want you. But not if you are going to continue to act like this. So you leave the house and don't come back until you are ready to make some changes.\" She stuck to that, too. He didn't leave for two more days because he kept telling her he would do different and begging to be allowed to stay. She had drawn a boundary and stuck to it, and he left. She was fully prepared to be single again. They actually did end up working things out in the end. You can't let someone stay and continue to treat you badly. Sure, a marriage takes work and compromise on both sides. Couples therapy can help you both learn to communicate in a healthier way with each other and can help you realize what areas in the relationship need work. You may not realize how some of the things you say to him comes across, and he may not realize how what he says does to you. A therapist can help you with this so that you both learn how your words can hurt. But you need to know your boundaries and be prepared to stick to them and not compromise your boundaries. That means following through on the threat to leave when he continues to abuse you. Someone can't do that if they are too scared to be alone. If they feel they need the other person in their life. These patterns are developed in early childhood from what we learn from our parents. When someone has grown up in a dysfunctional family, it is all they know. Even when you can say that you realize it is a problem, you still don't know how to stop it because you never learned any other way of interacting with people. Something that took a lifetime to learn will take time and work to overcome. Be patient with yourself and find a good therapist. You can't change your partner. Work on you, and when you begin to heal and feel healthy, the right people will come into your life and stay. The more you focus on trying to change the wrong ones to be what you want the more frustrated you will become."}]}

Therapists do not prescribe medication or have access to it. Most therapists avoid involvement in custody battles due to the probability of their records being used in court and their requirement to testify. While therapists can make mistakes, it is highly improbable for one to knowingly engage in such a major ethical violation. Such actions not only result in the loss of their practicing license but can also lead to criminal charges and imprisonment.\n\nIf therapists assess that the other parent poses a risk to the child, they do not need to employ illegal methods to prove this. If you possess concrete evidence of such misconduct, there is a procedure for reporting the therapist to their licensing board. All therapists are licensed within their respective states, with different types of licensures. In custody situations, accusations from the other parent are expected as emotions tend to escalate. However, do not make baseless accusations against the therapist or the parent in an attempt to enhance your own image or to discredit them. Only accuse them if you have evidence of their wrongdoing. If this incident has genuinely occurred, it should be reported. However, be certain before attempting to jeopardize someone's career.\""}]}

Try having a conversation where both of you can discuss something important, for example, not during a commercial for a TV show. Maybe your partner will be willing to listen to you for about five minutes, asking questions to learn more about your experience, like an investigative reporter would. See if your partner is able to understand the essence of what you're saying by summarizing it for you. Remember that hearing you and understanding what you're saying does not necessarily mean that he agrees. Also, consider if there are events in your past that are affecting the way you perceive this relationship between your partner and another person. We all bring our own histories into relationships, and we unconsciously expect that what has worked in other relationships will work in current ones. Then, switch roles so that you can hear more about what he is experiencing, for example, what he likes about her. Also, consider having a discussion about taking a break if one of you becomes very emotional and needs some time away from the conversation. Discuss the possibility of a timeout that will last for a certain timeframe, usually between 15 minutes and one hour, and then come back to continue the discussion. Remember that the goal here is to learn more about what each of you is going through, not to find an immediate solution. This can be a challenging process, so you may want to consider working with a couples therapist to discuss it together."}]}

Now we've become friends, but there's this huge sexual tension between us, or at least I feel it when we're physically in the same place. Two summers ago, we saw each other casually for a while, but we never had sex then or while we were dating, which was only for two months three years ago. I'm now in my 20s, and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s. Despite the age difference, I know we're a really good match. We've never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out. I tell him everything. Also, my exboyfriend has a girlfriend now as well. He's been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years, besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing. That summer, I told him I didn't want anything serious and broke it off. Only a week later, he had gotten back together with his girlfriend. His girlfriend is kind of mean spirited. I'm sure she may be different around him, but I worry about him committing to her in the long run. They're supposed to move in together soon. But still, I feel this connection with my exboyfriend, and I feel like he does too. I don't know what to do. I need some closure or I'm not going to be able to move on from this. I don't know what it is, but it's driving me crazy. I'm so happy with my current boyfriend, and I know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling. He's such a good person. I also know my exboyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but I can't get it out of my head.

I want to just talk it out with my exboyfriend, but I don't know if that's a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face. If he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me. If my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed. On one hand, I want my exboyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but I would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too. Where would I go from there? On the other hand, I feel like I can't move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this.

Is there a physical connection with your ex that you don't have with your current partner? It could be that your partner is wonderful in many areas, but that you just don't feel excited about him for some reason. That's a pretty important element to be missing. It may be that, even if you are happy with your current partner, you still hold something special for your ex. If you feel the need to see what is possible there, I think you have to tell your partner about that and end it with him first. You can't have everything.

Still, relationships can change if one person changes since changing one part of a system will change the system itself. Besides starting to work with a therapist on what you can do differently, reflect within yourself on the situations when problems arise between the two of you. See if you can figure out what you wanted and what your partner wanted in that particular moment. Was one of you trying to help the other, and the person felt insulted by the suggestion of needing help? This is only an example of how intentions are misread or not welcome by one partner from the other. Also, keep in mind there is a limit to everyone's flexibility.

One of the terrible results of being abused in a relationship which is expected to be loving, safe, and supportive is that the one who is being abused starts to question their own judgment, rights, opinions, overall way of thinking. This happens because partners who are intimately involved with one another are very meaningful. Regardless of how irrational, wrong, mean, selfish, intimidating, thoughtless a partner is to the other, the person on the receiving side gradually starts questioning whether they are wrong for not accepting these sorts of interactions. Stick with what your own intuition tells you. There is a part within each of us which knows the truth of what is going on. Leaving a relationship is always difficult to some degree. People are in familiar patterns of daily behavior, no one wants to suddenly \"be alone\", even if this only means showing up as a physical body, not as a truly loving partner, no one wants to start telling others about a breakup, answer questions about it, feel blamed, worry what others think.

Also, most places have a certain sort of structured initial session that must be done, but after that, the decisions are largely up to what you and the clinician feel is helping. If something is or is not working, communicate this with your therapist. This is a big deal. Most therapists I know actually welcome this feedback.\n\nThere is a fair amount of research into the idea that the therapeutic alliance the relationship that you have in the context of working through the reasons that brought you into therapy is very important.

The death of a child always leaves a lasting reminder to the parents of a very painful time in their lives. The good news is your awareness that you and your spouse are not connected in a satisfying way. There are many possible areas to examine in your relationship as partners and as parents. If your observations and theories about your spouse's outlook and conclusions are accurate, then the first step is to have direct conversations together on the topics you mentioned. What needs clarifying is her reasons for wanting to leave the marriage. Often, a crisis such as the death of a child motivates someone to deeply explore other intimate relationships. Keep in mind that exploring deeply does not necessarily mean ending the marriage. Also, be aware of your own frustrations and marital discontent. Be ready to openly discuss your feelings and uncertainties. There is no such thing as one happy partner and one unhappy partner in a marriage. Each person is part of a system and can only be as satisfied as their partner. The conversations that address relationship hurts and disappointments hold a lot of emotions and can be difficult to stay focused on.

Concentrate more on what you'd like from your marriage. This will naturally raise the questions and criteria of what to talk with your spouse about and what to ask of them. Think over whether you wish to end the relationship or not. Since they haven't taken any action, then for the moment, you can assume they are not sure of what they want. Once you feel a little more clear on your opinion about your marriage, including feeling uncertain if you'd like it to end or continue, then you will be able to tell your spouse the suggestions you have for resolving the dispute matter and emotions. Try to redirect your speculations about, \"what do they want\", \"I wonder what they're thinking\", back to answering these very reasonable questions, about yourself. This will strengthen your own purpose in clarifying where to start and guide a discussion with them. Good luck."}]}

Also, sometimes there are medications that you can take in addition to medication A. In addition to talking with your healthcare provider about changing the medication, try to track your levels of anxiety on a scale of 1 to 10 throughout the day so you can get a pattern of what is happening. Also, consider writing down what is happening before you have anxiety attacks. This may help your healthcare provider know what medication may be helpful to you or what changes could be made. \n\nAs far as how to discuss this with your healthcare provider, I would suggest mentioning the symptom changes you are having anxiety attacks that are not helped with 0.5mg of medication A and ask what they would suggest that might help. If your healthcare provider suggests taking you off of medication A, I would recommend talking about the reasons why you would prefer to stay on medication A and what your concerns are about coming off of it. You could also ask whether anything could be combined with medication A. \n\nThere are also many other anxiety medications.

Why do I feel so alone?\n(Social Relationships Depression)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It has been said that depression is often the result of a blocked goal. Often people struggle with both anxiety and depression but have difficulty determining which is the most important issue. For some, depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated, they discover that they are anxious worried about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief. When there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts either in their mind or in practical application to resolve the anxiety, depression is often the result. In this type of case, depression is not the main or underlying issue. The anxiety is the underlying issue. Having \"a lot on my mind\" sounds like anxiety. Unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with \"emptiness.\" In the question above, I would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having \"a lot on my mind\" and determine where these might be coming from. Has there been ongoing rejection from peers? From family? If so, why does this seem to be happening? Isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain. Where does that need to protect originate? Are there unmet needs from childhood? Are there traumatic life events that have created a need to self-protect as a defense mechanism? \n\nWe can feel \"alone\" even when in a crowd of people or at a party. This has nothing, in this case, to do with being around people. It has more to do with how we view ourselves. If there is a prevailing message or script that has been internalized that says, \"You are worth nothing\" or \"You don't deserve the company of others\" then being around people will not alleviate the problem but only exacerbate it. I would want to evaluate how one feels about themselves and what negative messages one has received and has repeated to oneself over time. \n\nThe Developmental Needs Meeting Strategy is a therapy aimed at addressing unmet childhood needs. If there is specific trauma that is associated with socializing with people, then EMDR can be very helpful in desensitizing and reprocessing the trauma. Looking at whether this individual's issue with emptiness is straight depression or whether it is depression as a result of unresolved anxiety is key to determining a treatment strategy."}]}

Another book that might be helpful is \"Codependent No More\" by Melody Beattie. In the meantime, until you can work through your personal issues, absolutely do not enter into another relationship.

Perhaps, ask them if they would be able to set up times for the two of you to hang out, without anyone else present. Additionally, it wouldn't hurt for you to find some other ways to spend your time away from them. Now might be the perfect opportunity to pick up a new hobby or hang out with different friends. Keeping yourself busy in healthy ways and processing your feelings of sadness will likely help improve your mood. Good luck to you."}]}

You cannot change your mother's feelings and responsibilities, which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness. It must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her. This type of responsibility usually produces an enormous amount of stress and pressure because your mother and niece would both need to adapt to this new relationship, living situation, and the feeling of being \"abandoned.\" Not knowing the history of your relationship with your mother and how you respond to each other in times of need, it may be difficult to find the right recommendation on how to deal with this situation. Nonetheless, it is not easy to have to face daily complaints and you may have to set a healthy balance between empathy and boundary setting with your mother and some personal boundaries for yourself. It is likely that your mother's \"complaints\" may be her desperate cry for help because she does not know how to cope with stress or how to ask for the right kind of support. In this case, you could calmly and respectfully tell her the next time you hear her complain, \"This must be very difficult for you because I hear the stress in your voice almost every day.

I feel helpless in this situation and would like to suggest that it might be helpful for you to seek some professional help and support to deal with such a big matter of importance.\" When empathy and understanding are communicated, recipients are usually more open because they hear and feel the caring behind it and are more likely to seek additional help. After sharing this message of empathy and encouragement to seek help, the next step is to protect yourself by explaining to your mother where your limits are so that she understands what she can expect from you. This means that you can decide the kind of support or help you are willing to give your mother and/or niece that is within your ability to provide without feeling overwhelmed. This could involve inviting them to dinner occasionally, taking them out to see a movie or inviting your niece over to give your mother respite.

For some people, polyamorous relationships - those involving more than two people - are acceptable. This does not work for everyone, but if each of you agree that that is okay, it may work for you and your spouse. If it is something that you are both open to, it is often beneficial to have more than one discussion about the details of what is acceptable for each of you.

Discussing this would likely be a sensitive conversation. From what you mentioned, has your spouse been diagnosed with a therapist? If so, do you know if they would allow you to attend one session so you can better understand their feelings? Perhaps they would benefit from it, as the therapy office provides a controlled environment. This way, at least you would be aware of their perspective. You could also inquire whether they are open to hearing your desires and wishes in your relationship.

I'm here to tell you that living in the now or being mindful is a skill anyone can learn. Unfortunately, the only way to do it is to do it. What a paradox! But there are plenty of other skills that we are not born with: walking on stilts, riding a bike, swimming, and driving a car are good examples. You can't learn them by reading about them.\n\nHaving said that, I can recommend two books on the subject: \"The Power of Now\" by Eckhart Tolle and \"When the Past is Present\" by David Richo. Richo asks that we don't beat ourselves up about dwelling on past events. This is nature's way of reminding us that we have unfinished business. But while we are attending to the wounds and confusion that litter our earlier lives, we can prepare to inhabit the expanded present that awaits us.\n\nHe offers three helpful steps to making any important life change:\nStep One: Hold in awareness the behavior, belief, attitude, or characteristic you want to change in yourself and how you want to be different. Awareness is the opposite of distraction and stuffing.\nStep Two: Live as if you have already made the change. This is hard and takes courage, but you can do it. Ride that bike, even if for a foot or two.\nStep Three: Be persistent. Practice, practice, practice.\n\nJust as two-year-olds are able to walk confidently after hundreds of hours of practice, you'll be able to stay in the here and now as long as you want after trying and failing many, many times."}]}

When they do talk about bisexuality, they say things like they'll do anything or things that make me very uncomfortable because I am bisexual. I don't know if I am ready to come out to them.\n(Family Conflict LGBTQ)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello and thank you for your question. Being bisexual can be particularly challenging because it is often misunderstood, even by people who are supposed to be part of your own community, such as lesbians and gays. It happens so frequently that there is actually a term for it - bierasure. This is simply something that happens when people deny that bisexuality is a real thing or discriminate against bisexuals due to their beliefs. The unfortunate truth is that you can never be sure how your parents may react to this kind of information. It sounds promising that they are accepting of other sexual orientations, and it may simply be that your parents lack education about bisexuality. With accurate information, they may come around, but there is no way to be sure. Some of my colleagues have already given you good information. Here are some more things that you can consider and questions you can ask yourself before making the decision to tell them: \n\n1. If they don't respond the way you want them to, have you developed a support system to help you through it? This is very important. The truth is that all the friends in the world won't prevent pain or sadness if your parents don't respond as you hope, but they will at least be there to remind you that you ARE okay as you are. And that is critical for you to remember.\n\n2. There is great information on the internet about bisexuality that you can offer your parents if you think it would be helpful. It may be important for them to know the kind of damage that is being done to bisexual adults and young people because of the myths surrounding bisexuality. Here is an article from GLAAD about bierasure: [link removed]\n\n3. Coming out to people is obviously deeply personal and should only take place when you are ready. Sometimes people get pressured from friends, media, and even people they are romantically involved with to come out before they are ready. It really is up to you. If you are feeling pressure from others, don't feel bad about setting your boundaries and telling them that you will come out on your own time. Intimate partners should respect you enough to understand this.\n\n4. Something else to think about is your own comfort in being bisexual. Just because someone is LGBTQ doesn't mean that they necessarily want to be. Many people struggle with this. Having your own doubts or insecurities may also play a part in how comfortable you are in telling your parents. So, perhaps do some self-exploration about your feelings toward yourself.\n\nSometimes people take friends with them when they decide to come out to their parents. This is something you may want to consider. The important thing to remember is that you are okay. Really. If your parents don't respond well, that doesn't mean that they never will. Some start off upset but then work their way through it. Best of luck to you."}]}

There are a few things that people find more personal than their intimate relationships. When we feel connected to our partner, sex can be the best thing since sliced bread. However, if we feel disconnected in some way, sex can feel degrading and even painful. I don't know the specifics about your relationship or how comfortable you are in talking to your partner, but this is one of those situations where communicating your fears is a good idea. The only exception to that would be if you believe they are actually a threat to you in some way. If you believe that, then you should do whatever you think is safe. It sounds like there is a part of you that is already afraid, and if that is the case then remaining safe is your top priority. Assuming you are able to share with them your feelings, telling them what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate and sexually healthy. Sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for all parties. All parties should feel respected and able to say no to anything they are not comfortable with. I call the respectful agreement between sexual partners \"sex trust\". Sex trust means your partner respects your boundaries. It means they won't degrade you sexually with hurtful words, pressured sex, or forcing or coercing sex in ways you are not interested in having. Your personal safety and mental well-being are what is most important. Now, if there is a part of you that is curious about BDSM and may be interested in exploring it, there are many websites that you can visit to learn more information. I will warn you, some websites and articles are better or worse than others, but you may at least feel more informed. Many people engage in BDSM and have fulfilling relationships, but again, it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants. It is also important to know that BDSM is not just one thing and people practice it differently based on their comfort. If it is something you are uncomfortable with, then you shouldn't feel obligated to do it. I hope this was helpful. Be well."}]}

I'm too ashamed to tell anyone.\n(Behavioral Change LGBTQ)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello and thank you for reaching out to ask for help. Surely this is a very confusing time for you. If you have never had these feelings and desires, it could certainly shake everything you thought you knew about yourself. My guess is that you becoming sick around the time that this started is likely a coincidence, but I understand how you would make the connection. I have a feeling that a few things may be going on here. It is really hard to say since I don't know you, how old you are, etc. But, I will share some thoughts with you. Some people, when they have undesirable thoughts that really surprise them, have a really tough time getting rid of them. Our reaction to the thought can be very strong, and our tendency to try to block it out, stuff it, avoid it, etc. is not always successful. In fact, it's usually not. It's like telling you not to think of pink elephants. I would be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now. So, rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing, sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosity and without judgment. Where is this thought coming from? What are my feelings about it? Asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution about what is going on. One possibility is that you have developed anxiety about your thoughts, and now you are in the process of obsessing about them. However, another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and gender. I get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe that is the second possibility. And that is okay. You can try some of my suggestions, but you can also see a counselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion. I would suggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues. You can usually find out what a counselor works with on their website. What is important is that you find someone who is nonjudgmental about what you are experiencing. I wish you well."}]}

I don't kiss or have unprotected sex with them. It's a one time thing, and I never see them twice.\n(Intimacy Human Sexuality Marriage)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, and thank you for your question. The question about whether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answered by you. However, here are a few things to consider and questions to ask yourself to help you find your answer. 1. Do you feel like you are violating your own values or morals? This is important because we all have different values and morals surrounding sex, love, and monogamy. If you value monogamous relationships and find yourself cheating on your partner, then you may feel like you are living in contradiction to your values, and most people are not happy when they do that. However, if monogamy is not something you value, then perhaps it is time to reevaluate the relationship and determine if it is still right for you. Not all people want monogamous relationships, and that is alright. Finally, if you value your partner's feelings and know that the affairs would hurt them, then your behavior may again be in contrast to your own values. That can only be determined by you. 2. Based on how you describe your relationship, it sounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is. From the outside, it looks like the affairs are a way to get even with your partner or to feel better after an argument. This is something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a relationship and gets replaced with contempt. We can simply stop caring about how our actions hurt each other, or potentially hurt each other. Perhaps the question to ask here is when you look out toward the future with your partner, is this the pattern that you want to keep? The pattern of very little sex, argument, and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs. 3. What are your goals for this relationship? If we start to become disconnected in a relationship, we can begin to do things on autopilot. Get up, get the kids up, go to work, come home, and go to bed. None of which requires any intimacy at all. Are you still able to see the hopes and dreams you once had for this relationship? 4. Have you considered seeking marital counseling? Not having affairs won't actually fix the part of the relationship that is leading you to have them. If there is something broken, it sometimes requires some help to get it fixed. Hopefully, these questions and thoughts will help you come to some kind of conclusion about what is right for you and your relationship. I certainly wish you well."}]}

You are clearly resourceful to reach out for help. Good for you. I have a few ideas and perhaps other counselors will add thoughts too. First, good for you for taking care of yourself and making good decisions, such as not getting into the car with someone who is intoxicated. It is important to consider your safety above all else. To answer your question, it is common for people to blame themselves for others' actions. There are reasons why we do this. For one thing, someone may tell us that their behaviors are our fault. Depending on our relationship with that person, past experiences, and our self-esteem, we may start to believe it. What is important to remember is that your parents have the responsibility to ensure your safety, not the other way around. I am concerned about both your physical and emotional safety and well-being. It sounds like your father has an alcohol abuse problem, and living with someone struggling with addiction can be hard, especially for a teenager dealing with school. You may want to check if your school has a counselor or someone you can talk to. In some states, what you have told me may need to be reported to child protection services. Ask the counselor what they are obligated to report if you're concerned about that. If you don't know a counselor, think of another adult you feel comfortable talking to. They may have ideas. Some states have nonprofit chat lines or hotlines for teens to call if they are struggling. Be cautious with online searches, as not every website is reliable. This is a tough situation for you, so focus on taking care of yourself while searching for support. Sometimes things like this can bring us down and make us stop doing things we enjoy. Try not to let that happen. Pursue your interests and find fun activities to distract yourself from overthinking. Take care of yourself by eating well and exercising to manage stress.

We all have faults and if that's what we focus on, that's all we will see. My hunch is that your most annoying trait might be your negative self-talk. How ironic is that? There's another irony here...your goal is to be a better partner...but when you are self-critical, your focus is on you, not her. Every moment that fear grabs a hold of you is a moment that you're not being present in the actual relationship; you're gazing at your imagined faults. Fear steals your ability to focus on your loving partner. Maybe take a moment to imagine how she sees you...all of you.

I wonder where the anger is coming from. Learning what is at the root of it can shed some light on what the problem is and can provide some relief in itself. I would also suggest doing some self-exploration and seeing a therapist for individual sessions to gain a clearer insight into the cause. There are also several actions you can take on your own to help control your anger and communicate more effectively. Here is what I would recommend you try: \n\n- Take time outs: When you feel yourself becoming upset, excuse yourself and take a time out to either think about the most appropriate course of action or redirect your thoughts altogether. Often when we become angry, it is difficult to see the issue clearly as our emotions get in the way. \n- Do deep breathing exercises: Close your eyes. Breathe in slowly to the count of 4. Breathe out even slower to the count of 6. Practice this for about 5 minutes, 3 times a day, and focus on nothing except your breathing during this time. Once it becomes routine for you, it will be easier to apply during situations in which you are angry or upset. \n- Change negative thought patterns: Try and recall or be aware of your thoughts, particularly when you are feeling angry. What are these thoughts telling you? Are they valid or logical? Is there factual evidence to support the negative thoughts? Often the answer is \"no.\" Learn to stop the negative thoughts and replace them with logical and more positive ones. \n- Communicate effectively: As a speaker, you want to use \"I\" statements by telling the other person how you feel instead of blaming him/her by using \"you\" statements. For example, you might say something such as, \"I feel sad when you don't come home at a decent hour and I don't get to spend time with you\" versus \"You always stay out late and don't even care about me.\" The speaker should also avoid using black and white language such as \"always,\" \"never,\" etc. As the listener, you want to validate what you hear so that the other person knows that you are listening. You will also want to be responsive and offer fair solutions. \n\nI wish you luck in using these tools and learning about where your anger comes from."}]}

One is an attempt to replace maladaptive thinking by examining the distorted thinking and resetting the fight-or-flight response with more reasonable, accurate ones. As an example, \"I'm scared of spiders.\" But if you change the thinking from being scared to \"I'm bigger than the spider,\" it allows the mind to reach a calmer state.\n\nMindfulness-based therapy can also help focus on the bodily sensations that arise when you feel anxious. Instead of avoiding or withdrawing from these feelings, remain present and fully experience the symptoms of anxiety. Instead of avoiding distressing thoughts, open up to them in an effort to realize and acknowledge that they are not literally true.\n\nAlthough it may seem counterintuitive, fully realizing the experience of anxiety enables the release of over-identification with negative thoughts. You can practice responding to disruptive thoughts and letting these thoughts go. By remaining present in the body, you'll learn that the anxiety being experienced is merely a reaction to perceived threats. By positively responding to threatening events instead of being reactive, you can overcome an erroneous fight-or-flight response."}]}

If you place all your emotions and identity solely on one thing, like your pets, losing that thing can cause significant emotional distress. It's essential to have a diverse range of interests, such as friends, hobbies, and games, which you genuinely care about and enjoy.

However, view this situation as an opportunity to understand what is happening between you and your husband when you try to communicate. Sometimes, the approach to dialogue can be a factor. I suggest paying attention to how you initiate conversations with your husband. Check if blame and criticism are present. When blame and criticism are included, bids for connection can quickly derail. It might begin with phrases like \"why don't you...\" or \"you aren't...\". Partners can immediately become defensive if they feel attacked, and such an approach can be perceived as an attack. Additionally, consider the time of day when you approach your husband. The timing can make a significant difference for couples to truly be present for one another. If you notice this pattern persists, it may be worthwhile to seek professional help through couples therapy.

Long distance relationships are difficult to keep alive because you don't ever see each other in person. Talking, texting, and video chatting isn't enough, and the longer the physical distance remains, the more difficult it becomes to keep an emotional closeness. It may be time to evaluate the situation, figure out when, if ever, the two of you will be able to be together in person, and if you can and want to wait that long.\n\nDo you both want the same things out of life? If one of you wants to take the relationship to the next level but the other doesn't, then it doesn't matter if it's long distance or not. If you aren't on the same page with the relationship, it is going to be difficult to make it work. Trust is important. Issues with trust, insecurity, jealousy, lying, and hiding things from each other, being afraid to speak up and have an honest conversation -- these things can ruin relationships if not addressed.\n\nI know confrontation of any sort can be hard for some people, but it is necessary at times. Evaluate your true feelings for him. Are you with him for reasons other than love, such as being afraid to be alone or thinking you wouldn't be able to find someone else? Has he ever given you reason to be suspicious of his coworkers or friends before? Some people, unfortunately, develop a track record of indiscretions and give their significant others ample reason for distrusting them. However, if this is not the case, you may be unfairly judging his texting through the eyes of your own insecurities.\n\nIt may be time for you both to take an honest assessment of your own reasons for being in the relationship, figure out what you want, and make a decision. This may result in bringing the two of you closer and taking the relationship to the next level. Or, it could lead to a decision to end things. I know that can be difficult, but you both deserve to be happy and to be allowed to make the decisions that will lead to your personal happiness."}]}

Then what happens is, because we have that connection established, we instinctively cut back on those loving behaviors because we don't have to work hard to earn their love anymore. That sparkling feeling typically lasts a few years, long enough to procreate and keep the human race going, and then it wears off a bit, and you end up looking at each other thinking, \"how come I don't feel the same anymore?\"\n\nMostly, not always, and I'll get to that in a minute; all that this means is you've stopped doing all those loving things you used to do. It's as though you filled the car with gas, you've run out of gas now, and you're forgetting to put more in.\n\nThe first clear solution to this feeling is to bring back more of your own loving behaviors that you've cut back on. Act lovingly, and you will likely regain those feelings. Talk to your partner about this. It's okay to say, \"do you remember we used to do X, Y, and Z? Can we do that again? Can I get more of the foot rubs you used to give me?\" Ask for what you want instead of complaining. What are your 'love languages'? What are your partner's?\n\nMarriages need to be fed. It's that simple. Many things get in the way... children, jobs, but mostly complacency.

I can understand how difficult this time may be for you, especially if you have several unanswered questions due to the circumstances surrounding the death of your friend. It's during this time that you may experience the various stages of grief. This includes denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance.\n\nIn the bereavement process, there is no specific time frame or length of time for someone to work through each step. It's imperative to note that one may express each stage with different levels of intensity. Also, the five stages do not necessarily occur in any specific order. We often move between stages before achieving a more peaceful acceptance of death. Just note that everyone grieves differently. Some internalize their feelings and emotions, others express them externally, while others avoid them altogether.\n\nCoping with loss is ultimately a deeply personal and singular experience. Sometimes we feel that no one understands what we are feeling or going through, much less comprehend our emotional state of mind. What's important is that you allow others to comfort you through the various stages. My recommendation is to allow yourself to go through the emotions and feel the grief. Avoiding or resisting may only delay the healing process. Reaching the acceptance stage of mourning is a gift not everyone is awarded, but seeking the help of a grief counselor may assist in deciphering your emotions and set you on a more positive path to achieve closure."}]}

We respectfully tried not to have sex, but after hours of trying to resist each other, we gave in and we had sex. After that, I slept at her house every night for almost two weeks.

We told each other that we loved each other all the time, even while we were making love. A few days after Thanksgiving, she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently. I was very hurt and didn't understand.

Then about two weeks later, we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other in love, not just sex, but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her. So for her child's sake, she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen. She had told me all about him previously, and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him, but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child. Our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged, but she is torn and confused. She doesn't even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly. I know she needs time, and all I can do is take care of myself.

Your description of the relationship so far is that you are feeling a lot of emotional pain, alongside a deep attraction for someone. In some relationships, the benefit of what draws us together with someone is being able to learn more about our own deep sense of who we are, what we value and care about. This sounds more descriptive of your relationship than that it is a loving one. Your descriptions are of life, parenting, and relationship dilemmas, not about how much effort is being put in to be together for the long term. Try distinguishing your wishes to be loved with what actually is taking place in everyday life. Being aware of how much love you'd like to give and receive is valuable self-knowledge. Your ongoing emotional wear and tear of all decisions about the relationship that affect you, being the result of choices, sounds like the opposite of love. The relationship is very useful as an access in self-understanding of your needs and wishes. It sounds like this is its main value in your life, not that it is sustainable in reality. Good luck."}]}

It is important to note that I cannot diagnose you based on one paragraph, so it would be wise to consult with a qualified mental health professional in your area, such as a counselor or an MD, who can assist you in overcoming these self-destructive thoughts. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a highly effective counseling approach for obsessive thinking. If you are interested in working with a reputable CBT therapist, you can visit the website www.AcademyofCT.org. Additionally, I recommend reading my book, \"LIVING YES: A HANDBOOK FOR BEING HUMAN,\" which includes CBT concepts and numerous other tools to help with obsession and anxiety.

As long as you do not engage in criminal behavior, no professional can legitimately consider you insane or crazy. Take your time and seek assistance from professionals."}]}

Alcoholism is a disease that affects the entire family. Family members often unknowingly contribute to the alcoholism and enable the alcoholic to continue their destructive behavior.\n\nFirstly, it is important to understand that you cannot force your dad to change, and incessantly nagging or begging him to stop will only make him defensive and exacerbate the situation. You cannot change another person; however, you can change how you react to him and the actions that you and other family members take in regards to him. It would be helpful to learn about codependency, and I recommend a book titled \"Codependent No More\" for more information. There are also numerous articles available on the internet that may be of interest to you.\n\nIn summary, it is imperative that you stop enabling your dad. You cannot control his actions, but you can control your own. This means refraining from purchasing alcohol for him and making it difficult for him to obtain it. Do not lend him money or pay his bills. Do not cover for him or make excuses on his behalf. Do not bail him out of jail if he gets arrested. He needs to take responsibility for himself, and the consequences may include job loss or the revocation of his driver's license. If he refuses to change, there is a possibility that he may lose his family.\n\nBoth you and your family need to establish boundaries regarding what you are willing to tolerate. While drinking is ultimately his choice, it is your choice whether or not to tolerate the behaviors that accompany it. Many people enter rehab because their spouse threatens divorce if they do not seek help.\n\nIf you are an adult who does not live with your dad, the best course of action is to stop doing things for him. If you are a child living at home with him, this may be a situation that warrants involvement from child protective services in your state, known as DHS. They can assist with cases of child abuse or neglect, which substance abuse in the home qualifies as. It is important to note that alcohol is legal, and when consumed responsibly, does not pose a problem. However, the negative consequences of your dad's alcohol consumption cannot be ignored. Does he drive while intoxicated with children in the car? Is he responsible for minors while inebriated? Are there instances of domestic violence stemming from his drinking? These factors could prompt intervention from the authorities.\n\nI encourage you to seek out local support groups for family members of alcoholics. These groups are similar to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but are specifically for family members. They can provide assistance and support to you."}]}

It may be incredibly helpful to find a counselor you can both go talk with. Having a third party who is neutral and cares about your process and hers can be such a relief when you need to discuss things you feel scared about. Even just a few sessions can make a huge difference. If this doesn't feel possible for you right now, ask your fiancee for time to set aside for a meaningful heart-to-heart talk. Say you'd like to set it up on the calendar and make sure you have a babysitter for your son. Set aside at least 4 hours.

A 14-year-old having sex with a 20-year-old would be against the law, but someone the same age as her, or just one year older is not. \"Wrong\" can be defined in a lot of different ways, though. Is it against the law? No. Is it against your religion? I can't answer that for you. You can, however, have a relationship that is not physical in any way. It's okay to just be with her and enjoy her company. You can hang out, watch movies together, go on dates, do whatever it is that both of you enjoy doing. Your relationship can be anything you want it to be."}]}

Perhaps being accepted and supported during this phase of your life will help alleviate the panic attacks.

It's possible that you are shouldering the emotional burden of many people in your life besides yourself. If no one shows care for your situation, free yourself from trying to please everyone and satisfy their wishes for your well-being while they ignore your need for support. Be realistic about what you can give back to those who are blind to your emotional needs. Initially, this shift in thinking may raise your anxiety level due to the fear of losing everyone. However, eventually, you will find stability within yourself and realize that all you're asking for is some support during a difficult time. Hopefully, others will be more responsive to you.

When suspicion and insecurity arise, your job is to look at the big picture and the real situation. Is there any real evidence that they are being unfaithful? Remember that texting their ex is not evidence alone if the communication is about the children. Have they earned your trust? If so, then it's not fair to punish them for the actions of others. They are not your ex. Reassure your heart that you are their priority if the larger evidence supports that. \n\nAt the same time, you can let them know what triggers you. For example, them hiding their phone doesn't send you a good message, right? See, this is the chicken and the egg... are they hiding the phone because you've been overreacting when they receive a text? So let them know you won't blow up about them receiving a text if they don't conceal or password-protect their phone. Transparency helps build trust.

If you shake all the time, consider talking with your primary care physician. Sometimes that can be a hormonal imbalance or another chemical imbalance such as thyroid. One of the most difficult things about anxiety is that having anxiety, particularly panic attacks, can lead to anxiety about having more panic attacks. Also, remember that panic attacks are typically part of your brain's protective response to what it considers to be some sort of threat. You may have heard of the fight or flight response. When you have an anxiety attack, your body is preparing you to react to something that isn't actually a threat, so it's almost as if your fight or flight response is overactive. Here is an image that may be helpful. There are many different things you can do. You can practice breathing, mindfulness, meditation, or yoga techniques. If you decide to try some breathing techniques, try breathing in for a count of five, holding for a count of five, breathing out for a count of five, and repeating five times. Also, remember that it is easier to learn these techniques when you're not having a panic attack. At that point, it can be really difficult to use methods to not panic. Also, remember that panic attacks typically last 5 to 10 minutes. Using techniques to slow your breathing or become focused on the room around you is probably most helpful when you first start to feel anxious. Here are some other techniques that may help to decrease anxiety. As you figure out what is leading up to your anxiety, also consider asking yourself what is making that certain issue a big concern for you. Another important question could be when you have felt that way before."}]}

In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk.

Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you.

Surveying the demographic data on long-term relationships, it's pretty common for couples to start to struggle around the 710 year mark, and in fact, that's often when first-time divorces happen. And for lots of reasons... most of them having something to do with beginning to take one another for granted and no longer doing the little things that nourish the relationship and light our partners up. Seems like you've encountered this in your own relationship... where he appears to be neglecting your need for emotional connection with him. Doesn't have to be this way though. And from my own personal clinical experience, I can tell you that when even one partner is willing to make some small but powerful changes, they can often ripple outward to the other partner and bring about miraculous outcomes. So my encouragement to you is this: if you're still in love with him... even a little bit... and you're down to try something new, there's hope. As hard as it may be, I would ask you to try and focus on your own side of the street when approaching him. Use an open and curious approach with him. Ask him what he thinks he needs in a marriage. What is it about you he fell in love with? What helps him feel more fulfilled as a man and as a husband? What little things that you have done over the years does he appreciate? Like Sherry said, if you can get him talking, there'll be plenty to work with. We only need a spark to kindle a fire. If he can give you a list, you'll have a blueprint for getting him to reconnect with you, and it opens the door for you to offer him little suggestions as well. By the time a couple reaches the point where you're at, there's usually very little fun going on. We've stopped enjoying one another's company. Try and think creatively about some shared experiences he might be willing to do. A picnic? Happy hour? Concerts, museums, cooking class, new sexual behaviors... the list is as infinite as you want it to be.

What I want to focus on is the fear and anxiety you seem to be feeling that are deeply connected to your questions. Scary thoughts, negative thoughts, obsessive thoughts sometimes feel like they're out of control and there is nothing we can do to stop them, but I want to offer two techniques that might assist with your panic and anxiety.\n\nThe first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. I also realize that might seem really hard to do, but here's a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. Thoughts arise in the mind all the time, our brain is a thought machine. Many thoughts drift by like clouds and we don't pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way, i.e., scary, angry, happy, sad, and when those thoughts arise we can choose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particular thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety.\n\nSo, how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? One new skill to implement comes from the work of Rick Hansen, he wrote the book \"Buddha's Brain,\" he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. Hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way, the brain is like Velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. There are reasons that our brain works this way, but I don't have time to go into all of that in this response. So, it's just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking, actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories, this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time.\n\nIf a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments, and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought. I would also suggest when you're having the thoughts about death take a moment to notice how you're breathing. Often when we are feeling anxiety we are doing shallow chest breathing rather than taking in a full, deep breath or what is called belly breathing. If you take a moment to focus on your breathing and allow a couple of full breaths, bringing in the breath so the belly rises and then the belly naturally falls as you exhale, just noticing the breath and practicing breathing can slow down the anxiety cycle as it begins."}]}

How can I stop these thoughts?\n(Behavioral Change)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times, as well as feeling quite real. I want to acknowledge how terrifying they can feel, but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts. The first step in working with frightening or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts, and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. \n\nI also realize that it might seem really hard to do, but here's a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. Thoughts arise in the mind all the time; our brain is a thought machine. Many thoughts drift by like clouds, and we don't pay any attention while other thoughts arise and trigger us in a particular way, i.e., scary, angry, happy, sad. When those thoughts arise, we can choose to pay more attention to the thought, which can lead us down that particular thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety. \n\nSo, how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? One new skill to implement comes from the work of Rick Hansen. He wrote the book \"Buddha's Brain,\" in which he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our minds and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. Hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way: the brain is like Velcro with negative thoughts and like Teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. \n\nThere are reasons that our brain works this way, but I don't have time to go into all of that in this response. So, it's just important to remember we have to work on positive thinking, actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories. This will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time. If a scary thought arises, try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments, and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought."}]}

Looking for a DBT professional or group therapy setting may be particularly helpful, but a skilled professional can help you figure out how to identify other options even when you are experiencing overwhelming emotions. Without knowing your location, I also recommend searching to find your local helpline or suicide prevention hotline. The volunteers on the other end of the line can be very helpful even if your intention is not suicide, and they are likely also to be able to connect you with resources in your area.

Anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action.\n\nSome helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. The first I'd recommend is a calm breathing technique: breathe in for 45 seconds, and then out for 78 seconds. Try to repeat this for 35 minutes. Another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe, without judging, the sensations to yourself. Try to be very specific, such as \"my palms are feeling very sweaty, and I can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies.\" Then, try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad, just experiencing them as intentionally as possible. Combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful.\n\nIf you feel that these techniques don't help and your anxiety about everyday stressors is inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to, then I'd highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional. This professional can help you determine if therapy or counseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms."}]}

From what you have written, the emotional pain and helplessness you currently feel seem overwhelming. One option is to accept your feelings of hurt and insecurity.

Everyone has family legacy patterns of behavior and ways of handling emotions, handed down to them simply by living. All of what any child observes and how they are treated within their family context creates their foundational expectations of others. The best way of releasing yourself from hurtful interaction patterns is by being aware of your own feelings and intuition within close relationships. If you have a similar sense of hurt or that something is wrong, yet in a familiar way, then most likely you are in a relational pattern similar to the negative ones in your family of origin. This realization moment is your chance to more deeply see your own original trauma and try different ways of responding to these similar key situations. This type of work takes a lot of repeated effort because trauma is deep and childhood trauma is attached to loving ones' parents. Expect slow progress and expect more than a few tears. If it feels overwhelming, then a therapist for guidance and support would be very beneficial to the work you'd be doing within yourself. Sending lots of good luck."}]}

You're on the right track by knowing and sticking with your own standards of what qualifies as acceptable behavior by your partner. Since they were the one who broke your trust, they are in the position of earning back your trust. This is always a basic formula for couple's therapy in which there has been infidelity. Understand within yourself whether you'd like to continue being in a relationship with them and what you'd like them to do in order to start feeling more secure. If yes, then communicate with them about what you now know about yourself as a partner in the relationship. For example, some people who have been cheated on would like to know details about the affair, while others may want to see their partner's phone. Recovering after a cheating incident takes time. If they express their desire to earn back your trust, give them some time to show progress in this area. As the results unfold, you will gain clarity on the direction your relationship is naturally taking. As for the person at work, they will become less significant as you and your partner work together on establishing a more secure relationship.

There are moments throughout the day, even if they only last for a minute, when we don't experience that negative emotion. When we overgeneralize, using words like \"always\" or \"never,\" we may feel the negative emotion based on a false belief, which is unfair to ourselves.

It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast-paced environment in comparison to Europe. I often ponder what would happen if I only had one day left on this planet. How would I spend it? Well, that is a simple query. I would devote it to my family. However, it is easier said than done when we reside in a world that is always looking ahead to tomorrow, isn't it? It is difficult to concentrate on the present moment when we are so engrossed in what is to come in the future. \n\nTime management is a crucial factor in order to fully embrace life. Interestingly, it is now a mandatory subject in undergraduate college. Each person manages their time differently, and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do so. Personally, I prefer to maintain a calendar along with a to-do list. I always prioritize my most important tasks at the top of the list. This way, if I am unable to complete the entire list, I am not overly concerned about the minor things. When planning your day, it is essential to allocate time for work, meals, and leisure. As challenging as it is to resist working after finishing work, it must be done. Discipline plays a role in this process. If you struggle with this, perhaps you can seek some accountability by involving a coworker who can ensure that you don't bring work home after your shift, or your spouse/partner can remind you that it's time to relax and not work. \n\nThese are just a few ideas that I am suggesting. Remember, each person has their own unique approach to time management. I hope this information has been helpful for you.

I think the most important part of what you mentioned was that you do it because it makes you happy. For that reason, I would encourage you to keep doing what makes you happy.\n\nAs far as telling others or keeping it a secret, I don't really think that it's necessarily one or the other, at least not the first time that you meet. In other words, one part of your decision-making could be whether it is something that you always want to address on the first date or perhaps something that you address after you've known each other for a couple of meetings. The answer to that question may also change depending on whom you are dating. I would imagine that each person you are with mainly due to a different decision this was when to disclose this.\n\nIt sounds like this is an important part of you, so I would think that if you were going to date someone long term, you would want them to know about the most important parts of you, including that. I also encourage you to remember that if you meet someone who is not comfortable with this, that does not mean that there is anything wrong with what you are doing but rather something that the other person is in some way deciding not to continue learning about or choosing to have someone they are dating like to crossdress.\n\nI'd also ask you to consider this: Are the people who you say this to expecting it? My guess is that the answer is probably not. Along with that, are they going to have questions? I would imagine so. Are you comfortable answering questions? I wonder if you could figure out yourself or with friends or perhaps even with a therapist how you would answer these sorts of questions:\n\n- What exactly is crossdressing?\n- Does that change the gender that you're attracted to?\n- What does it mean to you?\n- Why is it important to you?\n- And what do you want your listening person to know about you related to crossdressing?\n\nThere could even be ways that you can start the conversation by asking them to be open to listen to you and ask questions about what they are thinking before they make any quick decisions about you or the relationship.\n\nI certainly hope that you find the right person for you.

How do I get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time?\n(Relationships Marriage)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thanks for reaching out. This is a great question. Communication is definitely a two-way street. One person cannot participate in a discussion. It takes a talker and a listener. Furthermore, communication will break down if each party is only focusing on his or her agenda and is not open to what the other person is saying. Since I can't ask you questions about what is going on, I am going to make a guess at one situation that comes up a lot when I work with couples. One person focuses more on solving the issue than listening to their partner. This can be frustrating for the partner who wants to just be \"heard.\" I understand that you are working really hard to listen to him and he might not be putting as much effort into listening to you. That can be really frustrating and difficult, and I want to acknowledge you for wanting to improve your relationship. One of the best strategies to getting heard is actually to be a good listener to someone else. I know you are probably already a good listener, and for you to work on listening skills may seem counterintuitive, right? You want to get heard, and now you are the one doing the listening. But this can really create more effective communication if you invest time working on doing some active listening in your relationship because then you get to model those skills for your husband and allow him to see what it feels like to be listened to, and then you can even teach him some of those skills. In other words, you practice specific techniques that you can use and then teach later on.\n\nHere are some skills for you to use consciously, and then you can teach:\n- Pay attention and use your body language to convey that you are in the conversation. No texting or distractions. Lean in. Focus.\n- Listen for content and for emotion. Clarify what you don't understand. Try to understand the person's underlying emotions.\n- Don't rush to judgment or to changing what is going on with the person. Sit in a place where you are really curious and want to understand what is going on.\n- Encourage the other person to continue speaking. Nod and vocalize that you hear what they are saying.\n- Ask questions to get to understand the other person's point of view.\n\nI believe when we can model these kinds of listening skills, and the other person feels heard, they will be more likely to listen to us. If you don't find that this doesn't spill over in that way, then have a discussion about what you are practicing and that you are learning these skills to be a better listener so you can understand him better. Then explain how it might be helpful if you both tried it. If there is push back from him, set up a trial period to just try the skill, perhaps for two weeks and see if it helps. If communication is really breaking down, then it might be time to work with a counselor who can help with these skills.\n\nBest of luck to you."}]}

Regardless of whether or not you are sensitive, it is okay to want better communication with those who are important to you. When we feel that we are being talked down to or being ridiculed, it is difficult to not take it personally. It sounds like you have taken the first and necessary step in resolving this by bringing up the issue to him. Is it possible that the delivery of your message is causing him to feel blamed or defensive? Try communicating with him during a time when you are not upset and when it is out of context. Begin your statements with \"I\" as opposed to \"you.\" For example, you can tell him, \"I feel angry when you raise your voice at me\" instead of \"You always yell at me.\" Also, avoid using black and white terms such as never and always. Additionally, offer suggestions as to ways that he can better communicate with you. Maybe he just doesn't know how to. Lastly, when delivering a message, I like to use the sandwich method by starting off the discussion with something positive and ending it with something positive. For example, you may say something to the effect of \"I enjoy the discussions we share and really value your opinion. There are times that I feel angry when you talk to me aggressively. Perhaps you can try talking to me using a calmer tone when I bring up heated topics. Let's try and work on this together.

There are many different types of things that may be helpful here. I can give you some general ideas, but if some of these things don't get you to where you would like to go, consider seeking professional help.\n\nRemember that you can only guarantee change in yourself. You can ask the other person to make changes, but you can't control whether they do or not. You can control your reactions and what you do about your own thoughts, feelings, and actions in the relationship.\n\nIf you want to talk about something important or you really want the other person to listen, first ask whether this is a good time. Try to communicate without blaming, pointing fingers, or asking them to change. This can be difficult, but it also opens up a lot of doors for effective discussions.\n\nBe mindful of how you communicate. Make sure your message is clear and conveyed in a way that the other person can hear what you're actually saying. If you speak in an angry or aggressive manner, it can be difficult for them to listen and understand. They might only focus on your anger rather than the content of your message.\n\nIf the other person is able to listen to you and accurately restate what you are saying, let them know how important that is to you. Acknowledge their effort and understanding.\n\nWhen asking questions, try to avoid starting with \"why\" and instead use \"what makes, how, when, where, who\" etc. Starting with \"why\" can sometimes be difficult to answer and can trigger strong emotions that the other person may not be ready to deal with right away.\n\nAlso, remember that listening and reflecting what you say does not imply agreement. It is important to discuss this with the other person because just because they are hearing you doesn't mean they are agreeing with you.\n\nLastly, some people may struggle with effective listening skills. Not everyone is taught how to listen well until later in life. Sometimes, listening to someone can be challenging and make them feel vulnerable. If you notice that the other person is really struggling to listen, it may be helpful to ask them if they know what makes it difficult for them.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful to you."}]}

Kids fight for different reasons - wanting attention, wanting respect, feeling jealous, wanting space and to be left alone, or a whole bunch of other reasons. Regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting, most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others. One of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them. These conversations should be centered on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them. It is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong. The more they are able to understand each other and feel understood, the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other.\n\nOne exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is \"active listening,\" where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding. This is hard to do, but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are.

We respectfully tried not to have sex, but after hours of trying to resist each other, we gave in and we had sex. After that, I slept at her house every night for almost two weeks.

Continue to ask if she has more to add until she doesn't.\n\n2. Validating. You tell her you understand why she feels this way. If you don't understand, then find a way. You can also say, \"That makes sense\" or \"I hear you\" or \"I get that.\"\n\n3. Empathizing. Tell her how you think she must feel about what she's telling you. Your job is to try and feel what it feels like to be her.\n\nThis is a very different way of communicating than we're used to. My guess is that the arguments, discussions, and debates you've had with her have been counterproductive because you're both trying to win. With Imago Dialogue, you both win.

The goal is to replace negative thoughts and behaviors with more positive alternatives. It is crucial to acknowledge that managing depression and anxiety alone, without any assistance, is not recommended. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a proven technique to assist with these conditions, and it requires a therapist specialized in this approach. It is important to recognize that there are certain aspects of life that are beyond our control and should be accepted. Spending time attempting to change uncontrollable factors, such as the actions of others or unfortunate circumstances like the recent loss of a loved one, a broken relationship, or a disabling injury or illness, is fruitless. Rather, focus on modifying your attitude and thoughts about the situation you find yourself in. Life is bound to present unpleasant events, and some individuals may react strongly, leading to profound depression, while others possess effective coping mechanisms and can rebound. Acquiring positive coping skills can be facilitated by your therapist. Many individuals fixate on altering unchangeable aspects of their lives yet neglect the areas they can actually transform. Remember, you have the power to take action. Reflect on this quote: \"The outcomes you experience are largely influenced by the choices you make. Only by making changes can you expect different results.\" Another quote worth considering is: \"You either find a solution or find an excuse. Never claim to have no choice because everyone always has options.\" Although you may dislike the choices you are confronted with, the reality remains that choices are available. Unsatisfied in a relationship? You possess the ability to leave. Hate your job? Seek a new one. If something truly matters to you, you will discover a way forward. Do not waste time complaining without taking any meaningful action. Prioritize your self-care. Exercise is not only vital for physical well-being but also crucial for mental health. Adopting a balanced diet and engaging in regular exercise will enhance your self-esteem. Additionally, explore different types of meditation to find what works best for you. Progressive muscle relaxation exercises, visualization techniques, and various other methods are available. Begin implementing positive changes in your life today; you are capable of achieving it."}]}

The key to moving forward is to be loving toward yourself, to give yourself permission to grieve the loss, and to start cultivating new and healthy habits and patterns.

As far as learning how to listen, try some of these steps. \n\nAsk whether a certain time is a good time for your partner to have an important conversation. If they have a subject that they would like to discuss, consider listening to them as an investigative reporter and asking questions that help you to gain more understanding of their experience. These questions usually begin with words like who, what, where, when. Questions starting with the word why can sometimes make people very uncomfortable because they may not explicitly know why they are asking for something or feeling a certain way. You can try communicating this way for just five minutes or so on until you feel as though you can restate what your partner is saying and have them agree that you are recapturing the essence of what they are trying to communicate. \n\nThen you can switch so they are listening to you trying to understand your experience. You could also start by talking about something that is important to you. Remember that stating that you follow or hear something that they are saying doesn't mean that you agree. Also, try sticking to one subject at a time. It's difficult to really understand one topic if you are on to the next within just a minute or two. \n\nTry to use the word want or wish instead of need. Saying that you need something or if your partner would say that that is not a need for safety or something like that can make whatever you are asking for sound like an obligation. That takes away from that whole motivation to change from inside the partner who is agreeing to change or trying to change. Something else to try would be using some sort of timeout. Consider this. \n\nDiscuss the idea of using timeout before you actually need it and before the discussion starts. Timeout is a way to give each of you a way to calm down for five, 10, 15 minutes, or maybe even an hour. When there are a lot of emotions happening, each person gets wrapped up in protecting themselves from the emotions they are feeling and can lose track of what is actually going on in the conversation as compared to what they are perceiving. When using timeout, say to your partner or they can say to you \"I need an hour before we can go back to this.\" Then actually come back to the discussion. \n\nSome people are very afraid to use this technique because in the past not talking about something right away meant that it never was returned to and was never resolved in any way.

While it may be helpful to ask your partner what it is they may want from you, it is you that would be in charge of deciding whether you want to make that change and putting it into practice.

What you write sounds like you're not happy with this recent urge rather than that you and someone or others are having great and fun times together.

Asking a thousand different people would likely yield just as many differing answers. It may be helpful to discuss this matter with trusted friends or family members. However, I suggest starting with individuals who are open-minded and willing to listen to your inquiries and beliefs without attempting to persuade you to adopt their own views.

The local Salvation Army may be able to connect you with a non-denominational spiritual leader who conducts church services. They might offer guidance in navigating this topic if your friends and family are unable to provide a supportive atmosphere for such discussions. I offer a word of caution. In my experience, religious and spiritual ideas can lead to profound conversations with individuals who hold strong convictions about their own beliefs. Some people find it difficult to separate their own views from those of others. When engaging in discussions like these, it might be wise to first inquire whether the other person is comfortable discussing matters of religion or spirituality.

A major reason to end counseling is if the counselor feels that they do not have the skills or experience to work with the client. This may happen during the intake process or after working with the client for some time. If the clinician feels that the client is not benefiting from the therapy, it is ethical to suggest that the client terminate the therapy. The process of termination must not injure the client and, if necessary, the clinician may need to refer the client to other treatment modalities. Another reason to terminate working with a client is if the client needs a higher level of care. If the client has a crisis or is at risk of hurting themselves or someone else, they may need a higher level of care. In this circumstance, the clinician may need to involve outside services such as a crisis unit. A third reason to terminate with a client is if the clinician feels that they cannot remain professional with the client relationship. For example, if the issues that the client is working on bring up something significant for the clinician and they feel that they are unable to separate that from the professional relationship. In this instance, the clinician should refer the client to another therapist. Finally, if the client has reached their goals for therapy and no longer needs treatment, the clinician and client should terminate treatment."}]}

It may be helpful to work through some of this with a local therapist so you can get more specific ideas. Some other things that come to my mind are maybe talking about spending about 10 minutes or so discussing how you are feeling and seeing if your partner is willing to listen. Then you could ask questions about how she would react if you were doing something she did not like. This allows you to react to information she is actually giving you rather than your perceptions that sound like they are different than what she is trying to tell you. This gives you the power to receive the messages that she is sending to you.\n\nI would also wonder where you have learned that there wasn't much good out there for you and how you can stay present in the moment when you are with your girlfriend and see that she wants to be there with you. Perhaps you could look at what makes you feel emotionally safe and trusting with her and focus on that. You could even remind yourself \"okay, I'm here with my girlfriend and this is okay when I'm with her.\"\n\nWe all have different levels of defenses in situations with different people. It's common for people to see these things as black and white, either totally open or very self-protective. In reality, it's much more like a rainbow and the different shades of color that are available in the rainbow spectrum of white light. It's not really just red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet that we all know, but an infinite spectrum of shades of colors that fade from one into the next. You can change your level of defensiveness with your girlfriend depending upon the location you are in, the mood you are both in, the subject, etc. There are infinite numbers of choices and you can experiment.\n\nAnother thing that could help is to communicate about communication. If one of you uses a phrase that triggers something from earlier in your life or is really uncomfortable, you could discuss that. If she says certain things that make you feel really comfortable, you could discuss that as well. Hopefully, you can learn more about yourselves and each other at the same time."}]}

She argues with me over stupid stuff.\n(Stress Family Conflict)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is a common issue. You grow up gradually, and parents often forget to shift their habitual responses according to your newfound level of maturity and growing need for freedom and independence. I'm all for helping you find new ways to cope and interact with your mom. Ultimately, you only have control over yourself, so that's the place to start. You can remind yourself that Mom's behaviors don't mean that she doesn't trust you or love you. It's just that she has habitual ways of talking to you that seem stuck in the fourteen-year-old range. If you can see her responses as habits, rather than a reflection of how she feels about you, then you can keep yourself calm. The more calm you are, the more she will buy into it when you invite her into a different sort of relationship. Take a look at the picture from her perspective. She may feel overwhelmed with finances, and feel burdened by the mundane tasks in life that she doesn't know how to recruit help for. I bet your mom spends a lot of time picking up after you, cleaning, cooking, doing laundry... all those thankless mom tasks. Take a look at how she talks to you... is she nagging about chores? Can you see that underneath the nagging there's a pretty overwhelmed and powerless person who needs assistance? Okay, so my guess is that you both have a legitimate beef. She wants help. You want respect. Let's talk about how you get both. I propose that you sit down with mom and negotiate a different sort of dynamic. \"Mom... I see us as stuck in how we interacted when I was fourteen. Can we do this differently in a way that we both get what we want?\" Sell it as \"win-win\". Then you write down some things that end up forming a contract. The first part is stuff that's your business and your business alone - things you want your mom to respect, like your room, your school, your job, your personal relationships, and hygiene... Mom's voice has no place in these arenas unless you are storing food in your room and it's a health hazard. This is a \"Mom says nothing about\" list. The second part is about what Mom needs from you. What are her expectations about your role in the home as an adult? Does she want you to contribute to rent? Buy your own food? Do your own laundry? What items can we put in your control that would take some burden off of Mom? How will these things be enforced? What will happen if you don't follow through? Write it all down so it's really clear. It has to all be mutually agreed upon. The third part of the conversation is about how she talks to you and how you talk to her. You can let her know that you don't want to be told what to do or when to do it - that doesn't work when you're 20 years old. Listen to what she wants too. Beyond the contract you've just written up, anything else you want from each other is a request, it's optional, and whether and when you do it is at your discretion. My guess is that if she spoke to you with more respect, you'd be more willing to help out. And, I think if you participated a bit more she would nag at you less. Go for the win-win. I wish you well as you negotiate a new relationship with Mom."}]}

I need some strategies for dealing with it. What should I do?\n(Human Sexuality LGBTQ)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is a challenging situation to be in, as it seems like you are feeling very isolated from both your family and your friends. I don't know your age or gender, so please excuse any incorrect assumptions about you being under 18 and use what is useful from the ideas if you are older. One idea is to research online to find a therapist or a local clinic that has a therapist who specializes in gender identity. Most therapists who are transgender-affirmative also have other specialties and provide general therapy. Though I don't think lying to your parents is a good idea, if you feel you truly can't talk to them about your gender, then perhaps you can find a therapist with a specialization in gender identity who can help you cope with your gender dysphoria. You can let your parents know that you would like to see that particular therapist for other reasons, such as anxiety and that you researched them and liked their website. Work to find a therapist who accepts your parents' insurance if possible. You can also talk to the therapist on the phone first, before you talk to your parents about scheduling the first therapy visit. Therapists can help you learn some ways to manage feelings of worry, shame, and fear related to gender dysphoria. Depending on your family situation, many therapists will work to help you learn skills to safely communicate with your parents about what is troubling you. Your parents may actually surprise you and be more accepting than you think. Usually, when parents learn that you are suffering, they want to be open to learning how they can help you, even if it's awkward at first.\n\nReframing is a tool that helps you think about your situation from different perspectives. It's like looking at the same picture with a different frame, which can make the picture look a little different. Keep in mind that your situation is probably temporary and think about it in the context of your whole life. Can you tolerate another 2 to 4 years living as you are if you have many more years to live? If you are living at home, you will eventually become more independent and be able to make more decisions about your gender expression. Keep in mind the concept that is popular in mindfulness classes - \"This too shall pass\" or \"This is only for now\" - when you start to feel hopeless. If you start to overly focus on your gender or body issues, try to distract yourself with things that make you feel happy, like your pet, music, art, sports, etc., or stay busy. If you can, find a GSA or LGBTIQQ youth group that you can confidentially attend, farther away from home, to get some support. Work to find an ally, one person that you can talk to about what you are feeling. Making new friends online through social media can sometimes help break down the isolation you feel. Another idea, if you are under 24 years old, is to call a phone line (866-488-7386) in case you are ever feeling in crisis. You can also text chat with the Trevor Project (http://www.thetrevorproject.org). There is also a trans teen online chat group if you are between the ages of 12-19 (http://www.glbthotline.org/transteens.html). If you are an adult, you can get numbers to call in your state if you start to feel suicidal (http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org).\n\nDay to day, can you creatively work on your gender dysphoria? Yes. Are there ways you can focus on parts of your body that you love? Can you focus on that when you look in the mirror? Are you a writer? Can you write stories or poetry about the life you imagine for yourself in the future? Can you do small things that help you become more in touch with your gender day to day, like making small choices about your clothing - wearing clothes that are more unisex, that only you know are gender-related but others won't notice? You cannot force others to accept you, but you can work on self-acceptance and self-compassion. That work is best done in the company of others like you, as well as with at least one other person who understands you and whom you can trust. Good luck to you."}]}

In one sentence, I would say the following: Recognize that while you and your partner probably have common interests and areas of commonality, you are separate people, each with different wants, wishes, and desires. If you consider a diagram of two overlapping circles, they may share perhaps a third of the circle with overlap to indicate commonality (could be more or less), and then there are parts of the circles that are not overlapping, indicating separate interests.\n\nAs for ways that may strengthen any relationship, even the great ones, this is what came to mind. There are certainly more specific unique answers or elements for different people as far as the details, but here are some general ideas:\n\n- Try to have at least 15 minutes a week where you are spending time together and not problem solving.\n- Realize that listening to your partner does not mean that you are agreeing with them; it just means that you are saying that you hear where they are coming from.\n- Learn to hold on to your own wants, wishes, and desires while also recognizing those of your partner.\n- Set boundaries for what is and isn't acceptable behavior during an argument or difficult discussion.\n- Discuss how having important discussions can be anxiety-producing and consider having an understanding that if one of you or both of you feels overwhelmed, you can take a timeout for a certain amount of time. For example, you may say \"okay, I'm feeling really stressed about this right now. Let's discuss it in an hour.\" And at that time, go back to the discussion.\n- Consider what your partner's top three or four complaints about you may be. Check in with them and see how accurate you are. If you see validity in their responses, consider whether or not you may want to make changes.\n- Discover what makes your partner feel loved, valued, appreciated, or special.\n- Relationships are always in progress and constantly changing. Some anxiety around change is typical. Being able to effectively discuss the anxiety and actually listen to one another without being defensive, name-calling, finger-pointing, or asking each other to change is a true gift.\n\nYou may enjoy this quote: \"Connection is the energy that is created between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued when they can give and receive without judgment.\" - Brene Brown"}]}

Do you feel that by staying in the relationship, it's affecting your daily interaction with them? If so, that's something to keep in mind. Next, really looking at the pros and cons of staying in the relationship. A specific breakdown of what benefits come with staying and what are the ramifications. Vice versa for leaving. Include your partner. I think being honest with him and letting him know what you are thinking could be a great option. At least you aren't keeping something inside yourself to manage. Rather, you are being transparent with them. Sometimes a couple can come to an agreement that it may be time to end things, and other times it may be best to keep moving forward with a serious plan on how to move forward. Regardless, if you can't trust him and that feeling will never go away, it's time to address it. Couple therapy can be beneficial, as well as a therapist who can provide professional counseling."}]}

At the very least, you'll be actively resolving your guilt over cussing at him and fear of his retaliation."}]}

On a very basic level, there exists a primal need to protect them from harm. The hard part for parents is letting them feel those challenges and working through them as they get older. At some point, there is a moment that occurs when the role as a parent shifts. Children no longer need the basics: food, shelter, water, and safety as much as when they were toddlers, but rather, their needs shift to wanting more support, encouragement, advice, and room to make mistakes. This is where the ability to communicate with them, letting them direct the sails to gather the wind needed to move, is so important. Keep the lines of communication open and be available to give feedback when they ask for it."}]}

And Hollywood culture hasn't helped with romantic comedies and song lyrics telling us that when a man appears evasive, there's something to worry about. It's been my clinical experience, though, that most women value transparency and security in their relationships. So you might try sharing a little bit more about your history with this person. For example, where did you meet them? How long were you friends before you decided to call it quits? Why don't you want to be friends with them, i.e., what do you mean by \"kind of crazy\"? I promise this tends to matter to women. Were you ever intimately involved with or even attracted to them? If your partner can truly see that you view them as special and that they are your favorite person on the planet and have nothing to worry about, they may start to come around. Now, if they're more concerned that you might be taking calls behind their back, while I'm not typically a huge fan of sharing passwords or phone records, you might print them off and highlight the number and show your partner that you absolutely are telling the truth. And if you really want to step it up, I would be intentional about doing all the little things that you know your partner loves that helped make them fall in love with you in the first place, e.g., little love notes for them to find or sweet text messages, buy a rose or their favorite flower, do things that they appreciate, have their car detailed, do the laundry... have date nights... you get the idea. Bottom line, show your partner why out of all the people on the planet that you could be with, you chose them. And would continue to do so all over again. And why you love them as a person.

At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldn't like it.

I would suggest the first thing you want to do is, if you haven't already, have a calm and reciprocal conversation with your parents, telling them how you feel and letting them know what you need from them. If communication attempts are unsuccessful, then you will need to make a decision on how you would like to move forward. Unfortunately, you will not be able to change your parents' feelings or opinions, but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the relationship you have with your parents. It always helps to try and see things from another perspective. You might want to, for example, try to understand your parents' viewpoints and let them know you understand that they are upset. Validating others' feelings can be very helpful in effective communication. Are you living with your parents and do they support you? If so, are you willing to give that up should you decide not to follow their rules? Know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply. Your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshiper. Not everyone will always approve of the choices we make, and sometimes we need to be okay with that.

Ask her if there is one thing you can work on this month to help her. In return, ask her if she would work on one thing for you - not yelling, taking a time out, or giving you advanced notice before losing her temper so you can leave the room. Furthermore, consider reading a library book on anger management and another one on dealing with parents' anger. Most importantly, if you ever feel unsafe, if your mother resorts to name-calling, hurting you, or breaking things, make sure you reach out to a trusted adult such as a school counselor, neighbor, aunt, or church friend as soon as possible.

How to stop abusing alcohol involves a few steps, most of them time-consuming, with slow progress and very often with tremendous emotional pain. The basic path is to figure out what motivates you to drink too much and be addicted. Almost always, addictions are rooted in the person's experience of feeling deeply ignored, humiliated, shamed, invisible, which is nothing pleasant, since a very young age, usually starting around 18 months. Most often, addicts are sensitive individuals who have been emotionally burdened by the adults in their family. With no outlet for emotional expression or nurturing, the frustration goes inward until the emotional pain feels overwhelming and without an outlet. So, people mask and numb their feelings with substances, whether it's food, chocolate, work, alcohol, or weed. Therapy that is humanistic-based is a better fit than one that is drug-oriented and diagnosis-oriented. If you want to get serious about knowing who you are, including any unfair treatment you experienced during your growing up years, you can do this. Once you have stronger self-respect and awareness, you would naturally avoid substances because they harm people. Harming oneself is the opposite of self-respect. Also, about your diagnosis, it may not be true at all. The US healthcare system loves selling drugs to people and clinicians in agencies and clinics are encouraged to find something wrong with people in order to find a new customer who will take drugs. See if you can find a therapist who is independent-minded and therefore free to interact therapeutically with you as a human being, not as a potential customer if they are able to label you as having something \"wrong\". This simply continues the long line of being shamed by others that created the addiction problem in the first place. Good luck."}]}

This is the idea that you feel like you are living with a roommate and not your partner or spouse. It is not uncommon for members of a couple to report feeling both physical and emotional distance. When we don't feel connected within relationships, this can be isolating and lonely. The emotional distance often makes us wonder, \"Am I important to the other?\" These types of feelings need to be better understood in the context of your own background and upbringing, i.e., who you are, and also better understood in the context of your couple. Feeling reconnected can occur, but there is not a \"one size fits all\" solution. As a first step, do you or your partner have any ideas of how to feel reconnected? Have you considered talking to your partner about the emotional void? Or how about discussing solutions together that might help, from individual therapy to couple therapy, to a weekly date night, to inquiring about one another's personal interests, to starting off the conversation about what both of you want and can do to reestablish feelings of connectedness? If this is too frightening, i.e., to address the lack of connection between you and your spouse, a first meeting with a couple therapist can likely help unpack what the possible solutions for your couple."}]}

I think the cause is my wife talked back to her once. Now, any little disagreement is magnified, leading to major disagreements. What can I do?\n(Family Conflict)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What you are describing is something psychologists have termed triangulation, which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been triangulated by your spouse and parent. This is often seen in families. It's seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.\n\nI'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third-party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two individuals who disagree. That's what therapists do every day. Sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation, it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two individuals who care for you and whom you love.\n\nIf you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life, and they both know it. Your parent may be afraid that they will lose you if they confront your spouse. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. The spouse has the power to dictate when and how often the parent gets to see their son. The spouse also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your spouse doesn't like their mother-in-law, they can severely hamper or damage the mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your spouse's viewpoint, this is the woman that they may feel like they can never live up to. If you regularly praise your parent's cooking, housework, gardening, or anything else, your spouse may feel that you are putting down their own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated. This can be especially difficult if your spouse and parent are nothing alike. I am not saying that this is the case with your family's situation. These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours. Regardless of what the cause is, if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue, your parent and spouse will begin to get upset with you when you don't agree with them. They will get upset if you don't align yourself with them against the other. They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one's side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should. In the worst cases, if it continues to escalate, you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your spouse and your parent, which may mean cutting off contact with the other, ending that relationship. Change the dynamics before it spirals even further."}]}

I'm not sure whether you have anxiety of public places, large crowds, being alone sometimes called separation anxiety, or some combination thereof.

Also, if you know what leads up to your anxiety, it would be good to know this as well so you can look for patterns. As for forgetting things, you could be anxious because you are forgetting things or you could be forgetting things because you are anxious. When you are having anxiety, certain parts of your brain are overactive because you are in a kind of protective mode. It's also possible that forgetting things and anxiety are not related. Something else to try would be to notice where you feel your anxiety in your body and put your hand there is a way of giving yourself comfort. Another thing about anxiety is that having anxiety can lead to more worry about having more anxiety. One thing that helps for some people is to go to the regular primary care doctor to make sure that there are no physical problems just for the regular physical so they know that there are no physical problems and that the anxiety will lessen in a few minutes. Also, if you are able to notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair, this is helping you to be mindful of your body and connecting you to your surroundings. During this in combination with naming your emotions can be soothing as well. For example, in the grocery store, if you are feeling anxious, you could say to yourself \"I'm anxious right now and I'm okay\" while gently shifting your weight from one foot to the other. No one around you would notice what you were doing and the motion may be soothing to you. Anxiety can have a lot of different causes and things that trigger it. If it is difficult for you to work it out on your own which is very common, consider talking with a local therapist so you can have more specific ideas.

There are many ways of dealing with anxiety and stress. Much depends on how serious the stress is. So here are a few ideas:\n\n1. Practice in front of a mirror. Sounds strange, but the practice helps.\n2. Ask some friends to listen to your presentations. Not so much for their input as to just get used to presenting.\n3. Focus on the material you are presenting. The subject matter is what you want to get across. Step away from your nerves and get into the facts you want to present. Let the material you present be the focus.\n4. Remember everyone else is just as nervous as you. Share your fears with some of your classmates and gain support from them. Focus on a friendly face during the presentation. Be a support to them in return.\n5. \"Fake it till you make it.\" Yes, it sounds blunt. But sometimes that's what it takes. Even if you feel like it, you won't die.\n\nSo much more can be discussed with a competent counselor. Take the time to let a professional help you work through this.

Generally, it's good for a functional non-abusive parent to spend time with his/her child, but only insofar as that doesn't cause your child unnecessary stress. That requires the two adults to act like adults with each other for the sake of their child. What's confusing for children is seeing their parents act uncivilly or manipulatively. Children also do well with routines, so regular dependable visitation is preferable to random visitation or, worse, not following through on commitments. But if one person is exploiting their child to harm their ex-partner, then visiting your child in that context may be stressful to him/her depending on what you mean by using your child as a pawn. When dealing with a hostile ex-partner, your first challenge is to negotiate rules and boundaries with your ex-partner about appropriate behavior for the good of your child.

The key is to find a balance that works well for you and your partners. Communication, as Robin mentioned, is crucial. The recommended resources above can help initiate those conversations. If you need further assistance, I encourage you to seek out a sex-positive and poly-positive counselor to talk to.\n\nBest of luck to you."}]}

Take advantage of breaks: It may be difficult to step away from your desk, but prioritize taking breaks, even if it's just for 10 minutes. Fresh air and a short downtime can help you feel better.\n3. End the day with a ritual: If you commute by car, consider creating a playlist for the end of the day. Take a walk, light a candle, or organize your desk and write down tasks for the next day. Sending a signal to your brain that it's time to end the day can be helpful.\n4. Set boundaries when working from home: If you work from home or are expected to be available after hours, establish clear boundaries. Use a timer to limit answering emails and have phone-free meals. Engaging in rejuvenating activities, such as spending time with friends and family, can also be beneficial.\n5. Take care of your physical health: Try to limit alcohol and drugs, and make an effort to move as much as possible. Getting outside and exposing yourself to natural sunlight can have positive effects on your well-being.\n\nThese are just suggestions, but even implementing one of these ideas can be a step in the right direction.

What can I do?\n(Anxiety Behavioral Change)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Biologically, fear is designed to protect us from harm. Fear is not always a bad thing and, in fact, can be quite healthy and appropriate depending on the situation. A phobia, however, is different. You used the term \"fear\" rather than \"phobia\". A phobia is an irrational fear, meaning it is not rational for you to fear that thing. If your situation is a phobia, exposure therapy can help. This consists of gradually exposing yourself a little at a time to the thing you are afraid of. Some people with phobias find that the irrational fear interferes with their life, and they do need to overcome it. Someone who is afraid to drive over bridges may go to great lengths to avoid routes that have bridges. People who are afraid of elevators may always use the stairs instead, which may not always be feasible. If overcoming a phobia will improve the quality of your life, then by all means, seek professional help to overcome it.\n\nEveryone has fears or things that make them nervous. Public speaking, asking a person out, fear of failure. Examine what your fear is and try to determine the reason for the fear. When you can get to the root cause of the fear, you can deal with that issue. A lot of times, it is a self-esteem issue. You may be able to peel back the layers of the fear and find out what's causing it and deal with the real issue.\n\nSome fears are caused by trauma. Someone with PTSD is going to have an exaggerated fear response and will find themselves being kicked into \"fight or flight\" mode over things that someone without the trauma experience wouldn't notice or react to. In cases like this, exposure therapy would be the wrong approach and could actually make things worse. If there is a possibility that a past trauma is the cause of your fear, I strongly urge you to seek a therapist, not just any therapist, but one who is trained to work with trauma and abuse victims."}]}

Starting a new job can be daunting, especially when you have to travel away from your home and family, which can exacerbate feelings of anxiety. Allow yourself to feel anxious about this new journey. It's common for us to be hard on ourselves, but think about what solutions you would offer a friend who turned to you for help. Additionally, seek out the right support. Talking to your physician is always a good starting point, as they can determine if there are organic influences causing your anxiety that may be beyond your control. Opening up to close and compassionate family and friends is also beneficial. It's important to turn to supportive people during times of emotional need. Discussing our challenges can temporarily break the cycle of anxiety. Remember, to further your success, you must prioritize your well-being. Having supportive relationships and relying on non-judgmental individuals is great. Leading a healthy lifestyle - such as eating nutritious food, getting enough sleep, and exercising regularly - can never fail to improve overall emotional health. Engaging in self-care measures, such as practicing relaxation techniques repeatedly, can help you become more familiar with your nervous system's reactivity and enable you to implement strategies to ease anxiety in various situations as needed. The more resources you have, the better equipped you'll be to manage challenges and concerns that may arise. You can also find valuable information on the internet, but exercise your best judgment and avoid anything that may not be appropriate for you. There are some wonderful apps available on most smartphones that can teach you and help you practice grounding strategies to alleviate anxiety. If you have access to therapy, you can explore more specific strategies that would best suit your needs. Good luck! I wish you a happy journey and abundant success."}]}

Cutting down or cutting out cigarettes is very challenging, and there aren't any one-size-fits-all solutions. Fortunately, there are a lot of tricks and tools that you can use to stop smoking.\n\n1. Many habits that we have are paired habits. If we do one thing, then we will do the other thing. Think about the activities that you do when smoking and try to pair those activities with another activity other than smoking. For instance, many people smoke while they drive. Consider planning another activity to do while driving. It might not be driving for you, but you get the idea. It might be taking a walk instead of smoking on your break at work.\n\n2. Create distance between you and the habit you are trying to break. This approach could be used in a variety of different ways. If you smoke first thing in the morning, consider leaving your cigarettes in a different room in your home. Walking the extra couple of feet could help you decide not to smoke. Leave your credit or debit cards at home and carry less emergency cash than a pack of cigarettes. With this strategy, you are trying to create some distance between you and the cigarettes so that you have to jump through extra hoops to get them.\n\n3. Consider cutting back before cutting out. If you are smoking 10 cigarettes a day, try smoking 9. Then cut back to 8 and so on. Having a plan to reduce harm may be more sustainable than cutting things out altogether.\n\n4. You could also talk to your doctor about the safety of nicotine patches. If you aren't already pregnant, this could be a great resource to help boost your success.\n\n5. Focus on what you are gaining instead of what you are losing. You may be losing cigarettes, but you are gaining money, health, taste buds, an increased sense of smell, lung capacity, a healthy baby, etc. You could plan small rewards or treats with the money you save from decreasing cigarette purchases. I recommend making these purchases small and frequent to keep up the momentum rather than waiting for a big payout a couple of months down the road.\n\nGood luck!

However, there is a caveat, namely, you will need the right counselor with the right approach. This leads to two questions: 1. What are the identifiers for the right counselor, and 2. What is the right approach? 1. What are the identifiers for the right counselor? The right counselor will almost certainly have a lot of experience. He or she will have done a lot of personal work and have an ongoing practice of inner work both on their own and with the support of an experienced therapist. This person will be viewing you as a human being with challenges, not as a diagnostic category. He or she will be willing to work with you over an extended period of time and have experience doing such work. Furthermore, they will be well-versed in approaches that are responsive to you in the moment and overall. The in-depth work will be collaboratively designed in an ongoing way that is responsive to you, the moment, your overall life experience, and their in-the-moment experience. It goes without saying that you will subjectively evaluate the felt sense of connection with this person and the feeling that they are invested in their work with you, value you as a human being, and value the connection. As well, it is crucial that you feel this connection and that your therapist 'gets you'. 2. What is the right approach? As Carl Jung stated, \"When the doctor sits down with the patient he or she must drop all theories and learn the theory of this person.\" The approach must include a bond between you and your therapist that is in a continuous process of development, attention to preverbal imprinting, development of awareness ability, ongoing development of the ability to attend to and stay with inner experience, development of a process orientation, attention to egoic structures that were seeded from the earliest days in the service of perceptions of threats to needs being met, identification of current egoic states and work with these inner selves and their relationship with each other to facilitate movement from developmental points of arrest, increased ability to access and contain nonordinary states of consciousness, attending to what is, and working with this in the service of moving towards optimal human development. Depression is generally experienced as the system shutting down. Anxiety is a signal that something is wrong. Anxiety is not the problem. It is a sign that there is a problem. The core of these issues is a lack of inner security that is the outcome of insufficient bonding. The work of psychotherapy is to establish an environment and a relationship that will facilitate work with the bonding ruptures and reinitiation of the developmental process that stopped at an early stage."}]}

I'm curious about why you're just now seeing her Facebook posts again. Are you feeling more open lately to seeing how she's doing in her life? I guess if you were open to having your sister even on the periphery of your life again, you will have to figure out how to handle those triggers. If you can't, maybe consider unfollowing her or detaching from Facebook for a while. So your sister is happy, or at least appears happy.

Where does your mind go? It's important to identify your worst thoughts in connection to her. When you have those worst thoughts identified, ask yourself \"What evidence supports that thought as truth?\" It's likely that either there's no evidence, or that the truth is so far from you that you can't know what she's feeling or thinking, which makes having those thoughts pretty futile. A therapist can help you determine what emotions are being triggered here. It doesn't help you and your happiness to carry around resentment, ill wishes, or the need for revenge. Forgiveness is not about saying that something was \"okay\". It's about saying \"It happened. I accept that I can't change it, and I don't want to carry the emotional burden around all the time\". Forgiveness is putting it down. She... trust me this is true...she carries her own burden of shame for what she did. For you to spend time feeling angry doesn't affect her burden. It only adds to yours. Can you find the tender emotion under your anger? You're hurt. Validate that hurt. Honour that hurt. Take care of that hurt. You can stay away from people who disregard your needs, and you have the power to forgive those who make mistakes out of their simple humanity if you want them in your life.

Empathy is the ability to look at the world through someone else's eyes or \"walk a mile in their shoes.\" There could be some people in your life for whom empathy is easier to feel and those for whom you have no idea what they are experiencing. Empathy is not usually categorized as an emotion, but as something related to emotions. For example, you could have empathy about someone's anxiety. I'm not sure whether you are also referring to the idea that you don't have sympathy for yourself or others. That's a different concept, but also involves different degrees. When you say you don't have emotion except anxiety, I wonder if you are saying that you have anxiety all the time and it may be covering up other emotions? If you are experiencing a lot of anxiety, try to look at what it connects to and find something that changes your focus for a few minutes. This could be any number of activities, such as watching TV, cooking, reading a book, or many other options. If you are feeling as if you are just going through the motions and not having a lot of emotions about anything, if it's just been a few days, it may just be related to a current stress that will lessen in a few days. If it has been quite a while, consider tracking your mood and looking at when you do notice changes in your emotions. There may be some variations that you are not aware of.

Well done!\n\nNightmares and flashbacks are strong indications of unprocessed memories, including associated beliefs, emotions, and physical sensations, that have not yet been healed. There are likely reminders, known as triggers, from the past abuse that are being activated in your current relationship, causing these unresolved memories to resurface and impact both your sleep and waking experiences. It is important to note that you are not intentionally causing this, but rather it is a consequence of what you have been through. However, it is understandable that you may feel a lack of control. The goal is to protect your current relationship, evaluate your self-image for any distorted beliefs and emotions, and begin the journey of healing from your past abuse.\n\nIn many cases, using Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) can help reduce the emotional intensity of your abuse memories, diminish or eliminate triggers, facilitate healing, and allow you to fully enjoy the present within your current relationship.

If you had this, you could do something like that. I'm assuming that you don't, though. There are steps family members can take through the court system to get someone involuntarily committed, but it is a lengthy process. I deal with situations like this every day on the job. The only time an adult can be committed against their will is if they are deemed by the doctor, such as at an emergency room, to be a threat to self or others. For instance, if he had suicidal thoughts and a plan to carry out the action, or if he had homicidal thoughts against someone else and a plan to carry it out, he could be placed on a short hold, but these holds only last for a few days. This still isn't a long-term solution. An adult has the right to refuse treatment and the right to make their own choices, no matter how bad those choices are. If you have a way to get him to an emergency room whenever things like that happen, such as being found sleeping outside in 12 degree weather, it will help a lot. They may or may not do a short-term commitment for treatment based on the situation that brings him to the emergency room, but it's a start. They can help set him up with appointments for psychological treatment and he can get on medications. You can help by taking him to appointments and making sure his medications get filled. However, you can't force him to take the meds, so this may be something that happens frequently. With enough of a paper trail of many emergency room visits and that sort of thing, you'll have a better chance of getting a court-appointed psychological ward stay. Some tips about emergency room visits: don't send him alone. Always go with him or have someone go with him because you will be able to give the treatment team better insight into what's going on than he will. He may say everything's fine and he wants to leave, so they won't have any reason to keep him if that is the case. Go with him. If you do obtain Power of Attorney, take the paperwork with you when you go to the emergency room and to doctor's appointments because they aren't just going to take your word. They need to see the actual paperwork. Having it on file in their system isn't good enough because paperwork expires, etc. Take it with you at all times. You can also compile his medical records and that sort of thing to take with you so they can see a full history of what's going on. Keep in mind that if you do obtain Power of Attorney, this makes you his guardian and you have to take care of him. Otherwise, you can get reported for vulnerable adult abuse and neglect. In fact, your mom ignoring and not helping may already put her at risk of that because she is willingly doing nothing to help someone who clearly needs the help. She won't be financially responsible for the hospital or doctor bills, but should be held responsible for his safety. Someone should. There are group homes for people with schizophrenia. \"Being responsible\" for someone doesn't mean you have to pay their bills, it just means you are going to make sure they get the care they need. That care may be placement in a long-term care facility like a group home or a nursing home. Psychological inpatient hospitals aren't long-term, so you do need to look into other long-term options. Psychological inpatient stays are temporary and are meant to stabilize him, they're not where someone stays forever. Good luck and keep up the good attitude. Work with his treatment team. Ask for a social worker. If they see family members who want to do the right thing and want to help, they'll help you even if it does take a while to get things sorted out. The worst thing any of you can do is NOT go to appointments and that sort of thing."}]}

We tend to spend a lot of time and energy running away from or trying to get rid of most of those emotions and the more we do that, the more we set ourselves up for failure and disappointment. As a result of viewing our human emotions as \"bad\" or \"wrong\", we often get caught up in a trap of thinking we have to overcome them or get rid of them before we can do what matters to us. In reality, you can do what is important to you while having your fears. \n\nMy question for you is, what would you do if this fear was completely gone? What behaviors would you have if you were the ideal you? What skills, knowledge, or personal qualities would you develop? What kind of relationships would you have? \n\nI imagine your fear has kept you from achieving those goals because your mind tells you can't do it until the fear is gone. I challenge you to do the following exercise: \n\nWhat is a goal you would like to achieve? For example, I would like to change careers. \n\nWhat actions are necessary to complete this goal? For example, see a career counselor to determine my ideal career, go back to school, get a certification, network with others in my desired industry. \n\nWhat thoughts, feelings, or urges might get in my way? For example, thoughts of \"What if I fail? I'm not smart enough. I can't do it. I'm too busy to put energy into this.\" Feelings of fear, shame, excitement. Urges to distract myself through drinking or watching TV instead of taking action. \n\nIt would be helpful to remind myself that it is natural to have these thoughts, feelings, and urges, but I can take action anyway. I deserve to have a fulfilling life. \n\nThe smallest and easiest step I can take now is to research career counselors in my area and write down their phone numbers. \n\nThe time, day, and date that I will take that first step is tonight at 7pm. \n\nAt least think through these answers, but it is most beneficial to write them down.

Once you are able to employ that in your daily life, you can start facing your fear. For instance, let's consider a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge. We would build a hierarchy of fears, which is a list of fears ranging from least to most. For example, the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relaxation technique. Then, he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while using the same relaxation technique. After that, he can gradually move closer to the bridge, even standing on it, all the while relaxing. The ultimate goal would be to cross that bridge. Another approach is flooding, where you expose yourself to the fear until you no longer panic. In the movie Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne, who has a great fear of bats, goes into a cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them.\n\nSecondly, examine your fears and consider if they need to be worked on. Some fears are healthy. For example, if I were a therapist in New York City and someone came to me saying \"I'm scared of snakes,\" I would probably say that it is okay because there are very few snakes left in Manhattan.\n\nHope that helps!"}]}

It is important to understand that during anxious moments, our body and mind react due to our instinctual or primitive brain, which triggers the fight-or-flight response. This response is initiated by the hypothalamus, releasing chemicals like adrenaline or cortisol into our body. One way to manage anxiety is by identifying the specific triggers like fear, stress, negative thought patterns, insufficient nourishment, or lack of sleep. Maintaining a daily journal can aid in recognizing these patterns and triggers. Once identified, you can mitigate their effect by acquiring new skills and techniques, reducing stress, and ensuring enough sleep. Deep breathing, also known as belly breathing, is an effective technique to alleviate anxiety. When you inhale, focus on expanding and raising your belly, and as you exhale, allow your belly to deflate. Many of us tend to take shallow breaths using our chest, which prevents us from fully inhaling. Obtaining a complete breath is crucial in helping us relax during times of stress and anxiety."}]}

I know seeing a therapist can be challenging when traveling, and online counseling could be a good solution. In the meantime, here are a few of my favorite anxiety-stopping strategies.\n\n1. Grounding Exercises: When you feel your anxiety increasing, take a deep breath and look around your surroundings. Take note of things that have in common (e.g., colors). For example, name all the blue things that you can see. You can also do non-visual grounding exercises, like recalling sports teams or state capitals. This will divert your attention from anxiety and help you feel connected to the space around you.\n\n2. The Pretzel: This is a seated pose that can stop any anxiety attack in its tracks. Start in a seated position and cross your dominant leg over your non-dominant leg. Then, stretch your arms out in front of you, with the back of your hands facing one another. Cross your arms in front of each other so that your palms are touching. Flip your arms into your body. You will end with your elbows by your side and your hands crossed under your chin. Close your eyes and take long breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This calming pose will help you get through even the toughest panic episodes.\n\n3. Bilateral Stimulation and Visualization: Start in a seated position with your hands placed on your knees. Tap each knee in an alternating pattern. Close your eyes and begin visualizing a peaceful setting. The combination of bilateral stimulation and visualization will help calm your body and mind.\n\nI could go on and on, but these techniques should get you started. They should help you manage anxiety in a pinch. Best of luck!"}]}

Human sexuality can be incredibly complex at times; for example, what turns us on at one time may not be what turns us on the next time. There could actually be a number of things going on, including him having performance anxiety. Maybe he had a bad experience with a previous partner that has left him scared to try again (we call this operant conditioning). It could also be that he puts you in a different category than previous lovers. Sometimes I refer to this as the \"hookerhousewife mentality,\" where a partner somehow gets the idea that when we truly fall in love, we treat that one differently, almost up on a pedestal. This drives many partners crazy until they're aware that this is going on and give their boyfriend/girlfriend permission to enjoy both the naughty and the nice with them. It could also be that he's not even aware that he's not doing these things. If you haven't asked him yet, you might try gently approaching the subject when you're not already in the bedroom or trying to get in on and inquire what he most enjoys about sex with you or has enjoyed in the past, or thinks he might enjoy. You can also share your favorite highlights of sex with him. Give him an ego boost and tell him what he does well while then asking him if he'd be down to go downtown. \"Baby, it REALLY turns me on when you kiss me during sex.\" If you continue to get the impression that it's somehow only about YOU or that he's just really hesitant to talk about sex in general, you might see if he'd be cool to chat with a counselor who specializes in sexual intimacy."}]}

If you are medically clear in the reasons for losing your erection, then reflect on what may be creating a loss in confidence in either who you are and what you're doing with your life, or whether your partner has these sort of problems within themselves. Often a problem transfers ownership of who shows it. If you are a sensitive person it's possible your erection problem reflects your partner's insecurities and self-doubt. If they are someone who is reluctant to talk about feeling unsure then in a certain way by you showing a problem, they can avoid looking at themselves. There may not be a direct cause such as usually exists in a medical problem. Medicine looks for symptoms to treat. Our emotional lives are much more indirect. If you feel stress at work or are unhappy in the place you live, for example, then your frustration may show up in your sex life. Basically, do a broad inward search of your life and what it holds and maybe ask your partner to do the same.

Many people find benefit to taking medications, such as Risperdal, Seroquel, and so on. These should be prescribed by a nurse practitioner or psychiatrist. I do not recommend a primary care doctor venture into this area, as a general rule. Discuss the options thoroughly and insist on a good rapport with your prescriber if you decide to go this route.\n\nSome people are having results with a talk therapist to develop coping strategies. There is a new and somewhat less conventional approach to challenging voices with a professional to assist you, rather than to suppress the voices, which medication will do. There is a peer-run organization and a general approach that attempts to live with voices in a different way. You can read about it in \"Living With Voices\" by Marius Romme. I have heard interviews but have not read the books and can't speak to its efficacy.\n\nNo matter what steps you decide to try, managing your stress, sleep, exercise, and healthy food is essential, in other words, just the daily care and feeding of yourself should be included in all of your efforts and bears surprising benefits to your brain and emotional health.\n\nBest wishes to you!"}]}

It sounds like you have a lot on your plates. Childhood trauma carries its negative effects into our adulthood and affects everyone who loves us. Your question is brief, so I'll just try to give general answers as best I can. From my experiences treating many people with similar experiences, the short, healthy answer is that you can't fix the situation and maybe not even be able to help. They need professional help. Period.\n\nWhat you can do is take care of yourself. With their background, it is not likely that they will be able to help you or take care of you in a healthy way. Your task needs to prioritize your own safety and well-being. Trauma and substance abuse are the definition of being out of control, unable to set and manage appropriate boundaries, and manage one's own emotions and behaviors. So they are unlikely to be able to change in the near term, certainly not without professional help. You might also benefit from help and support to understand your own role in your relationship and how you can make changes in your life. I am not blaming you for any aspect of their behavior, only acknowledging that there are two people in every relationship. If you have accepted their drinking and violent outbursts in the past by staying in the relationship, that is likely to perpetuate their behavior. And there isn't any way to handle violent outbursts. They shouldn't be handled at all, and if you have to be away from them during their outbursts in order to be emotionally and physically safe, then that may be what you will have to do.\n\nWe can never really change anyone else. The only person we can change is ourselves. Sometimes our behavior changes the odds of another person's behaviors, but it doesn't control it. I would recommend that you work with a professional to first ensure your own safety above all. Then make decisions about what behavior you are willing to accept or be connected to, and what you want to separate from. Whatever they do in their life, you will be happier if you manage your own feelings, set boundaries, etc. Let me say again that you would also benefit from some good insight and support as you continue your journey.\n\nWishing you healing and recovery."}]}

However, there are a couple of things you can try to address this.\n\n1. Parents: Sit down with one of them and express the seriousness of your need to talk about a deeply affecting issue.

They will call me back when they get a chance, or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is available.\nC - Decreased feelings of depression and overall functioning improves.\n\nThis is just an example, but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that affect your behavior, studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve.

It can be even more challenging if you are having a difficult time building relationships that are supportive at work. A couple of things to remember here: \n1. You are there to do a job and you are getting paid to do it.\n2. There is a reason or reasons for you wanting to be there and do that work.\n3. You know best what you need in order to be successful. \nThese three items can be helpful to remember, especially when we feel our emotions are taking over in a place where we do not feel safe to express them fully. If you feel like your supervisor is approachable, meaning someone you could talk to because they express confidence in you, let them know you are nervous about doing a good job. Also, let them know how you learn new tasks, information, or expectations so they can deliver the message in a way that you understand. Becoming a successful worker doesn't happen overnight, but each day you can identify what works for you and what doesn't by communicating with your work team, the easier it will be for you. We all had a first job once, and were all worried about doing well. Hang in there, and call a counselor if you need more help."}]}

Anxiety usually means someone did not feel well understood growing up and was rushed to comply with the wishes of others who were a regular part of their lives. Anxiety lessens as the person starts to know and accept their wishes and needs as valid. Allow yourself to learn who you truly are, in the spirit of accepting whatever you discover about yourself.

First and foremost, look into working with someone who specializes in working with individuals with challenges surrounding drinking. This would need to be assessed first since if it has been ongoing, it may be making the situation worse and given the time it has been utilized as a coping mechanism, there is reason to believe that the structure of your brain may have been affected as has been demonstrated by current neurological research. There are, however, ways to address this. As for coping mechanisms, the person you work with should also look at offering you alternatives such as the skills found within the Dialectic Behavior Therapy model (DBT), which has several useful tools to help address the underlying anxiety and difficulty managing emotional regulation. Mindfulness, another component of DBT, should also prove to be useful in both becoming aware of your state of mind and emotional state to allow you to make different choices, which has been supported by a growing body of evidence. There are also other tools designed to help repair damaged relationships. Well worth looking into. Seeking help is never easy, and it is only human to be hesitant given some of the cultural views of working with therapists. This is a difficult place to be in and one that is not easy to move out of, but sitting on it is not going to help it go away. Think of it this way, if you broke your arm, would you just wrap it up and hope for the best? or seek out a professional to help you set the break and teach you how to mend the wound. The same applies here. Think of it as first aid for the mind."}]}

The more we allow ourselves to experience and accept the pain, to acknowledge and make peace with it, the more we will progress towards healing. \n\nGrief comes in waves, resembling a rollercoaster ride.

Every \"first\" without a loved one, be it an anniversary, birthday, or holiday, presents its own set of challenges. \n\nIt is impossible to force grief to dissipate or expedite the healing process. However, what we can do is ride the wave, embracing the pain and expressing our emotions. Talking to our departed loved ones, conveying both positive and negative feelings, can be cathartic. Writing in a journal and taking care of our physical well-being, including nutrition and rest, are essential as grief can take a toll on the body. Reading inspiring books and surrounding ourselves with beauty and things that bring solace to our souls can also be helpful. \n\nLet us be brave and remain open to the world, embracing vulnerability with pride.

He's working on them and has improved. We started counseling, and he participated in one or two individual sessions, but we broke up again shortly thereafter. Now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining.\n(Relationships)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello and thank you for your question. I worked for a number of years with individuals who have been both abused in their relationships and those who have been abusive. Being involved in a relationship with a partner who does the behaviors you describe can be incredibly difficult and many would argue it is even harder than overcoming actual physical violence. I was a little confused about whether you are still broken up with this person or if you are still thinking about it. I am going to assume you are still undecided. Some of the things you are describing sound like emotional abuse. Even without physical abuse, being emotionally abused can still be traumatizing. When partners question and accuse, they are often trying to exercise power and control over their partners by hurting them with unfounded accusations. The accusations serve to make someone feel guilty and to manipulate them. For example, if your partner accuses you of cheating when you go out bowling with friends, you may choose not to go bowling just to satisfy your partner and prevent a fight from occurring. The person being accused or questioned often tries to prove over and over again that they have done nothing wrong, but it doesn't matter. And that brings me to the point of what some people who experience these behaviors do in order to start feeling like they have some power again. Here are just a few things:\n\n1. They realize there is no right answer. Trying to be logical with someone who doesn't want to be logical doesn't work. Many people simply stop trying to defend themselves against false accusations because there was no answer that would satisfy their partner anyway. In addition, the rules of the relationship seem to change on a daily basis, and what may be okay with your partner one day may make them angry the next. And this can leave people constantly feeling like they are on eggshells.\n\n2. They find support. Finding a support group or a group of people who remind you on a daily basis that you are a decent person is always a good idea. One of the things that can happen when we are with someone who does emotionally abusive things is begin to have a negative concept of ourselves. Surrounding yourself with people who remind you that you are a good person is a great idea.\n\n3. They reinvest in themselves. Try to find some time for yourself. This couldn't possibly sound more clich\u00c3\u00a9, but it is actually true. Whether that is taking up a new hobby or doing an old one. One thing that can happen when emotional abuse takes place in a relationship is the person being abused can begin to isolate and not do the things that make them enjoy life. Taking some time for yourself can sometimes bring things into perspective.\n\nI don't know if you are still in counseling, but if you are and you are getting what you need then that is great. If not, there are others you can try. It's important to find the right fit. As for the question of whether or not you should leave your partner, that is a question that can only be answered by you. But you could ask yourself some questions like these to help you decide:\n\n1. What are some of my values about relationships? Do I want trust? Honesty? Ask yourself if you have these things in your relationship.\n\n2. Do I feel like this relationship brings out the best in me, or does it seem to bring me down?\n\n3. If I want to stay in this relationship, what are some specific things that need to change?\n\nHope some of these suggestions help. Good luck to you. Be well."}]}

This is a great question, and I'm sure many others will relate to what you're describing. There are a few different ways we can understand your concern. First, it's important to understand that food is just food. Food is meant to nourish our bodies, provide us with energy, and sometimes reserved for special occasions and celebrations. But in many cultures, we place a lot of emphasis on food. We have food at every gathering and celebration. What's more, people almost expect food to be present at any get-together. And if it's not? Well, then forget about it. I see this time and time again with my clients. Donuts appear in the office, and it's almost like donuts have never been there before. Must eat one or two. However, we need to remind ourselves that this occurrence, or similar ones, will not be the last time we can enjoy this particular food. It is likely the office donuts have happened before, and they will be there again on another day. During these moments, I like to have my clients employ a \"Stop and Think\" method. Stop and think about your goals before you eat. Is this donut getting you where you want to be? Also, have my clients ask themselves how special this donut is. If the donut really is a special donut from the best bakery in town and you've never been there before, then now might be a time to have the donut. But if not, it would be wise to pass and wait until that \"special\" donut. Another aspect we need to remember about food is to think about what we're getting from overindulging or overeating. Are you trying to drown out other emotions? Are you trying to feel better, and the food gives you that feeling for a brief moment? What else is going on? This can be determined by utilizing what we describe as a Thought Record. A Thought Record involves tracking and identifying thoughts and feelings associated with food triggers. By targeting the emotions, we can then determine where they're coming from, as well as how to decipher them. A therapist can also help you understand your emotions related to food and will be helpful in assisting you with the Thought Record. The most important thing to remember is that \"food addiction\" can be a real problem for many people. If food is taking over your life and you are preoccupied and overwhelmed, please seek out help. Binge eating is the most common eating disorder and impacts the lives of thousands. There are lots of free resources and information available. In addition, I offer individual coaching and counseling through my website, and I would love to help."}]}

Even though she told me she didn't have any more pills, I found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications.\n(Social Relationships Substance Abuse)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, thank you for your question. I have worked with many individuals who have become addicted to benzodiazepines, like Clonazepam. It is a difficult journey for those who are striving to become clean. It is also a challenging situation for loved ones who are trying to be supportive. During these times, it is important to remember to take care of yourself as well. Regarding the idea of taking your friend's pills, my concern would be the potential legal consequences if you were ever caught with someone else's prescription medication, especially such medications. Our laws have become more stringent regarding prescription drug sales and possession due to the rise in prescription drug abuse. Additionally, individuals facing active addiction are likely to find alternative means to obtain their drug, so this action would do little to address the underlying problem. I am unfamiliar with the details of your friend's family situation, but involving them could be a better course of action if you're concerned about your friend's well-being. They might already be involved, but with your assistance, you may be able to persuade your friend to willingly seek treatment, which is generally more effective. Many states have involuntary commitment processes that allow a person's family to petition a court for forced treatment. The availability of this option varies from state to state. If your friend's family is unaware of this possibility, it might be worth looking into. Usually, a relative or a medical professional must initiate this process if it is available. I hope this information has been helpful, and I wish you and your friend well."}]}

It can be scary, frustrating, and lonely. Have you tried talking to them about your concerns? I would suggest starting there. There may be several reasons for their actions, some of which may have nothing to do with how they feel for you. Learning about what is going on for them will likely answer your questions and, depending on their response, may cause some relief.\n\nWhen initiating conversations about sensitive subjects, there are a few things that you want to remember. Tell them how you are feeling and what you are experiencing, rather than blaming them or telling them what they are doing wrong. Avoid using extreme, black and white language, for example, using words like \"always\" and \"never\". \n\nFor example, you may say something such as, \"I feel confused that we are rarely intimate and I'm wondering if you've also noticed this change,\" versus \"You never want to be intimate with me anymore.\"\n\nDon't be afraid to ask them questions. You deserve to know what is going on, as their behavior is affecting your well-being. I like to ask open-ended questions instead of yes and no questions. It allows for more clarity and a deeper explanation.\n\nLastly, ask yourself and possibly them what part you play in the recent changes. Do they feel that you've been distant? Do they need something from you? Let them know that you are willing to work things out as a team. If communication attempts fail, seeing a couple's therapist can be a great benefit. Having an objective party to coach you through this difficult time can give you the support that will create lasting changes in your relationship.\n\nBest of luck to you."}]}

Any suggestions or ideas?\n(Family Conflict Selfesteem)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, and let me say first, what a great question. There are so many people putting forth their 100% everyday and often times, do not get the credit they deserve. Without being able to fully understand where your question is coming from, I think there are a couple of different ways to look at this question.\n\nFirst, I think it's important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that you're \"not good enough\". Is that ACTUALLY what they said, or is this just what you heard? Sometimes, because of our own self-doubts and fears, we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others. Again, listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective. Is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern? If so, have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time you're spending on being \"good enough\". Explore with them how you feel you're already giving your best.\n\nIf the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have, then it may be time to explore the relationship. Some relationships we engage in can be toxic, especially if the other person is toxic. It may be they have their own \"stuff\" going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better. If you're in the direct path of this individual, then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire, as well. Explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life. If it's a relationship that MUST continue, then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems. Until they're willing to work on these issues for themselves, then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy, such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation.\n\nAnother perspective of this question is exploring the reason why it's important for YOU to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals? NO ONE will ever be 100% \"good enough\" for EVERYONE. Every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others. It would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives. The question becomes, what is it WITHIN you that feels the need to meet these expectations? There is most likely a part of you, yourself, as an individual that feels \"less than\" and feels as if you, yourself, are not good enough. It then becomes impossible to ever feel \"good enough\" for others because it's really YOU you're trying to feel good enough for. If you already feel as if you're doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself, then really work on LETTING GO of the rest. No one is perfect, and striving for perfection in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress. Find a middle ground in which you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals, and learn to let go of what's left. After all, tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more of your goals tomorrow.\n\nI recommend doing this by finding a mantra, a statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection. The mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation. I leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra, \"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.\" - Eleanor Roosevelt."}]}

Clearly, this is something that has you very concerned. Sometimes thoughts are just thoughts, and they are pretty harmless. Many people have thoughts of causing harm but would never actually act on them. They may not even want to act on them, they are just having passing thoughts. Other times, thoughts are a sign of something more serious, and we should seek help when they start to worry us. I would recommend meeting with a counselor to discuss these thoughts. It is usually a safe environment where you can get advice with little judgment. Now, if you begin to start thinking about causing harm to someone specific and making a plan to do it in reality, you should call for help immediately. By help, I mean 911 or a family member or friend. You would want to get help before doing something to harm yourself and others. Again, none of this is to judge but rather to encourage you to get the help you're seeking.

First, I want to say that it is great that you are willing to admit that you share some responsibility in some of the relationship problems you are having. This isn't always easy to do, but it sure is important if you want to see improvement. It does sound cliche, but communication really is the bedrock of relationships. And not just intimate partner relationships, but really any relationship that is significant to us. It sounds like you are saying that you have a difficult time really listening to what your partner is telling you and then responding in a way that is helpful. I want to tell you that you are not alone. Good communication skills are not really something you are born with, we actually have to learn them. The good news is that there is great information available to help you do that. Ultimately, some people must seek professional help through couple's counseling in order to get help with this process. This is because some of the hurt and anger could be at such a level already that you may need help setting boundaries, creating a plan, learning new skills, and staying on track. If that is not something you can afford or can do right now, here are a few suggestions that may help. Personally, I am a big fan of Dr. John Gottman. He is an expert in relationships and wrote a really great, easy-to-read book called \"The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work\". Dr. Gottman discusses the kind of communication that healthy couples seem to have, which can be helpful and worth trying. You can buy Dr. Gottman's book on Amazon for under $9. It's a good deal. There are a variety of websites that have good information that may help you build your communication. Here is one that I found that has a few good tips. You can try them and see if they are helpful. It is important to remember that like all new skills, communication requires practice and we surely fail several times before we start getting good at it. If you were ever a pitcher in baseball, then you know you have to throw thousands of pitches before you really start hitting your strike zone consistently. Allow yourself to make mistakes, own them, and start again. I hope these suggestions help, and good luck."}]}

First, I want to tell you how sorry I am for the experience you had with your parents. That is a grief and trauma that is certainly hard to imagine. Trauma and grief can affect us in many ways, and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives. It may be difficult for others to make the connection, but it is there. So, for example, if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex, a partner may take it as a personal rejection rather than a response to stress, trauma or grief. If your spouse will agree to it, couple's counseling may be your best bet. A counselor can help you with your communication and may be able to provide some education to your spouse about trauma and how it can have an impact on intimacy. If they don't agree to go, it may be worth it to go on your own. You still have a lot you are dealing with yourself. And sometimes our personal therapy can influence others, so it may be a good idea. It is important to remember that even though you are married, you have the right to make decisions about your body, and that includes when you want to have sex.

First, I want you to know that you are certainly not alone on this issue. Everyone, at some point in time, has a fear of public embarrassment.

They will try to avoid any situation that they even THINK will cause them embarrassment or anxiety. Escaping a possible embarrassing moment by avoiding or isolating may cause some relief at first, but then many times the avoidance will eventually lead to loneliness, isolation, and even despair. By avoiding, we can also miss out on things that make us feel alive and bring enjoyment. There are many self-help books that offer advice on this issue. You can do an internet search, and I recommend reading the reviews of the book. That is a great way to find out if others have found the book helpful. Another option is to seek a counselor to help you with this fear. I would recommend a counselor who specializes in helping people who have anxiety or social anxiety. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a good choice for helping with anxiety, but there are many others.

I say challenging because when situations like this arise, we often struggle to find the right words to comfort each other, and so we suffer silently with little support.\n\nHere are a few thoughts that I have, and perhaps others will have additional suggestions:\n\n1. Based on your main question, it seems like you genuinely want to be there for your partner during this difficult time. While I'm uncertain if he is open to discussing his health situation, letting him know that you are willing to support him and that you also need his support might be helpful.\n\n2. If possible, you could suggest the idea of seeking counseling together. A counselor can focus on various aspects that can improve your relationship and help both of you with the challenges you're facing.\n\n3. If your partner refuses to seek support, you may want to consider going to counseling on your own. Some organizations, such as hospices, offer support groups and other services that might be helpful. Remember, it is crucial not to neglect your own well-being.\n\nI apologize for any errors or mistakes in the original text.

I am very sorry that this was your experience with your family. I truly wish I could give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction. But unfortunately, I can't do that. Their acceptance of you is a journey, just like coming out is a journey for you. Sometimes families initially respond this way, but after time they become more accepting and even supportive. Unfortunately, there is no way to know for sure if that will happen. So, here are a few things I would suggest:\n\nSurround yourself with people and things that remind you that you really are okay as you are. That won't take the place of your family's acceptance, and I won't even pretend that it would, but it may help during those days when it hurts the most. And that is really important.\n\nPatience is not something that many of us are really good at, but this type of situation sometimes forces you to have some. When families first learn something like this, they may go through a period of shock. And then sometimes even grieving. They may even be worried if they are of a particular religion where being bisexual is forbidden. These things can take time for them to reconcile, so it may just take some patience.\n\nIf it is safe for you, try to talk to them. But if it becomes painful or hurtful, then you have the right to walk away. I do recommend setting up some personal boundaries for yourself and perhaps learn some assertiveness skills if you feel you struggle with them. The reason I feel that this is important is that people sometimes take a lot of abuse from family members and friends in times like you're describing. They may want to be accepted so much that they put themselves in hurtful positions over and over again, hoping that their families will come around. They may, or they may not. And if they don't, you deserve to live a life free of abuse and to feel confident and assured of who you are. To be surrounded by folks who remind you of that.\n\nIf you start seeing this pattern and you are struggling, chatting with a counselor may be a great idea. I am biased probably, but I think chatting with a counselor is ALWAYS a good idea.\n\nHope this helps. Be well. Be you."}]}

I am very sorry that you are experiencing this. To be honest, this kind of behavior is emotionally abusive, and you likely know that already. The unfortunate truth is, there is very little we can actually do to change another adult's behavior if they are not interested in changing it. Many people who behave in this way actually feel justified in saying what they say, or even believe that they are \"helping\" in some way by telling you how to improve yourself. What is actually going on is an attempt to control or change something about you by being coercive and abusive. It is important to know that this kind of behavior doesn't necessarily show up right away. That is why I am not surprised that you are a year into this relationship and are just now noticing these behaviors. Some people actually don't see them until they are already married. You didn't mention that there has been any physical abuse, but I would warn you that this is sometimes a possibility once a person has already begun to be emotionally abusive. Other things to watch out for is your partner trying to control who you hang out with, what you do and how you dress, etc. These are just more examples of emotional abuse and control. Here are some things to consider and some ideas: 1. You could talk to your partner about this behavior, if you believe it is safe to do so. Perhaps they will recognize that their behavior is not okay, and change. If not, then you may need to decide what you want to do about this relationship, given the fact that you cannot force them to change. 2. You can call a local domestic violence program. They not only work with people who have been physically abused or have been married. They are trained to talk about emotional abuse also. It may be a good thing for support. Your calls are confidential. 3. Check out the wheel in the link below. On it, you will find some other common ways that abuse can happen in a relationship. If any of these are happening to you, or begin to happen, talking to a domestic violence program, a trusted friend or family member, or a counselor would be a good idea. Be well...."}]}

I apologize for any struggle you may be experiencing. I have a few thoughts and perhaps my colleagues can contribute as well. Depression and anxiety are both chronic conditions, as you have experienced. This means they may always require treatment in order to find relief. Treatment may involve medication or counseling. Some individuals may need medication for the rest of their lives, while others may opt for counseling during periods of worsened depression and anxiety. As you mentioned, symptoms can improve temporarily but can also resurface. It is important to communicate any returning symptoms to your medical provider if you are receiving medication, or to your counselor. Skin picking and other behaviors are not uncommon for individuals experiencing anxiety. Many people report engaging in these behaviors as a way to alleviate anxiety and find calm. It is not surprising that you constantly seek change and even instigate conflicts. These are common methods of coping with anxiety and depression. It is natural to want to avoid, escape, and distract oneself from these feelings. However, distraction and escape are not long-term solutions and often exacerbate the problem for various reasons. Depression and anxiety can be treated, but it is likely that you will need some assistance. I recommend finding a counselor experienced in working with anxiety and depression. Medication can be helpful, but I still advocate for counseling as well. Medication can manage symptoms, while counseling can address the underlying issues and provide effective coping strategies.

Why am I feeling this way?\n(Human Sexuality Intimacy Relationships)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, and thank you for your question. Nervousness, when doing something new, especially something sexual that can feel so personal, is very common. Indeed, despite the fact that nervousness can be uncomfortable, it is also part of the excitement of trying something new. Many people who engage in open, polyamorous, and or other type relationships, will tell you that difficult feelings, such as jealousy and anger, do show up sometimes. This doesn't prove that there is something wrong with the relationship, it just shows that you retain normal human emotions while in one. And many people who are in polyamorous relationships have written about the work it sometimes takes to make such relationships work. Of course, all relationships take work, so polyamorous and other types of relationships are simply not an exception. There could be several reasons why you are feeling the way you do. One reason could be that you are simply not as comfortable with the idea as you think you are. Some time and good communication with your husband may help you with this. Another reason this may be bothering you is because, on some level, you are aware of the messages society gives us about marriages. They are supposed to be monogamous, heterosexual, etc. etc. Just because you may not agree with these beliefs doesn't mean that you haven't been influenced by them. We all have. Another reason this may be upsetting you is because it may feel a little frightening. Perhaps there are a lot of \"What ifs\" going on in your mind. When you get the \"empty\" feeling, it may be helpful to try to really nail down the emotions that are attached to that feeling. One thing that I do think is very important is that you communicate these feelings to your husband. It may even be a good idea to talk about expectations or \"ground rules\", if you will. It is important that you are both on the same page about what this is, and why you are doing it. If you continue to struggle, I suggest finding a counselor who has experience in sex and sexuality.

Overcoming fears is something that everyone struggles with at one time or another. Sometimes we come across something that scares us, we push through it and suddenly we aren't afraid anymore. But sometimes it can seem like our fears just take over and we cannot overcome them. There are some options: \n\n1. You can go to a counselor and receive some type of treatment. What kind of treatment would depend on the type of fears you are experiencing. For example, if you have a general phobia about something, they may use various techniques to help you manage it. \n\n2. There are different websites and even some self-help books that you can use to try to overcome your fears. When it comes to overcoming certain fears or phobias, exposure therapy is well-studied and proven to work. A therapist would help you with this, but some websites give instructions for how to do it yourself.

Now he is depressed and hopeless again.\n(Marriage Depression Selfharm)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello and thank you for your question. This is a very serious time. I don't mean to frighten you, but you are right to be concerned. The time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide. It is very important, after hospitalization, to get follow-up care with a professional as soon as possible. If your spouse has an established therapist, this is the time to call. It is also a good time to alert your support system of friends, family, clergy or others to let them know they are still struggling. This is good support for them AND you.\n\nIt is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt. Means really do matter. So, if you have a firearm in the home, it is really important to remove it. You can't remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with, but some things are more lethal than others. Firearms are very lethal. I am not sure what means they used last time, but try to reduce the opportunity for them to access it again. This is where your support system can help out. People can take turns hanging out with them until you are sure the crisis is over.\n\nIf you believe that an attempt is going to occur, talk to your spouse about going back to the hospital. If they refuse, you will want to find out what your options are to have them go even if they don't want to. I know the thought of that really hurts, but it can save their life. Calling 911 is always a good option if you are not sure. Usually, a suicide crisis, meaning they want to harm themselves right now, lasts a few minutes, hours, or days. Sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage, they no longer want to commit suicide. But, as you are indicating, that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again. So, it is always good to have a plan. \n\nIf you want more information, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. They will always answer at 18002738255.

This is certainly a tough situation. I have a few thoughts, and perhaps some colleagues will add some insights. You might take a few minutes to recall any conversations you've had with your father about transgender issues, or if you've ever heard him discuss it. This may provide a small clue about how well he could receive this news from you. For instance, if he has been following the news lately, transgender rights have been a popular topic. Does he have an opinion about it? While this won't definitively tell you whether he would be accepting of your identity as transgender, it might indicate if he holds any hostility towards transgender individuals. In truth, the best way to tell your dad is whatever way feels right for you. There's no right or wrong, best or worst way to approach this. If you want to have a private conversation with him, that's perfect. If you want to have a friend with you for support, that's equally perfect. Do whatever you feel is necessary. And, of course, you always have the option of not disclosing anything until you feel comfortable doing so. Unfortunately, it's impossible to predict your dad's response. Some parents are very supportive, while others may not be. This is why having someone in your corner for support can be beneficial. If things become heated, you'll have someone there for you. There are therapists who specialize in affirmative therapy, and they can be very helpful in guiding you on how to approach this conversation. You can also find stories on the internet about how others have come out. I recommend visiting the \"Let's Queer Things Up\" blog at www.letsqueerthingsup.com. It's a popular blog written by a trans man that I know, and he covers various topics related to transgender issues. Hopefully, some of these suggestions will be helpful to you. Take care, be true to yourself, and good luck."}]}

This is one of those times when you wish you could assure someone that everything will go perfectly, but unfortunately, I can't do that. There is no way of knowing how parents might respond until you tell them. The truth is that people have come out to their parents in many different ways. Some have told their parents directly, some drop hints, some have had others tell their parents, etc. The only \"right\" way to come out is the one that you choose. The one that feels right to you. That is the best way. Some people decide not to come out, and some wait for a very long time. Both of these things are okay. Coming out is deeply personal, and there can be real consequences to someone's emotional health and safety if they tell the wrong person. That is why it should only be done when you are ready. When you feel that you have the emotional and personal support that you need to take the risk. Sometimes people can feel pressured to come out, but I encourage you to do it in your own time. The truth is, there is a spectrum of how people's parents react to this kind of news. On one end, you may have the parents who shut a person out and are abusive, and on the opposite side, you may have parents that are totally okay with it and throw you a \"Coming Out\" party. Most parents are going to fall somewhere in the middle. It is important to remember that their feelings may change over time. Many parents struggle at first, but they love their kids and get better with it over time. If you decide to tell them, consider taking someone along to support you. Plan ahead on what you want to say. It can be an emotional time, so do what you need to do to take care of yourself. If you need to, leave. You don't have to stay anywhere where someone is being cruel to you. I wish you well and good luck."}]}

When faced with these kinds of difficult challenges, I usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be. Indeed, it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we don't feel very content with our lives. Perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions: What kind of person do I want to be deep in my heart? What kind of character do I want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching? How would I want others to describe me? Let's say that you want others to see you as being authentic, and you also value authenticity as something you want to live by. You may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now. That you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart. This is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation. So please, try not to feel alone. We all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc. And I am not just talking about being unaccepted by others, but a person may have a very hard time accepting themselves. Thinking about your values and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom, but I won't lie, it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time. For example, someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for, even if that means people may disapprove. That may cause a lot of pain, but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity. It may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy, which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them. I would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are, both as an individual and as someone's fianc\u00c3\u00a9.

It seems like you're concerned about the consequences of excessive drinking, and I suspect you already know the answer to whether or not you have a problem. You likely wish to stop feeling guilty and avoid cheating on your partner or experiencing other negative outcomes. Perhaps you fear becoming labeled as an \"addict\" or \"alcoholic.\" It's possible that you have a \"problem,\" but that doesn't necessarily mean you are an addict. I cannot determine if \"addiction,\" \"dependence,\" or other terms accurately describe your relationship with alcohol, but it does seem that it has started to have some adverse effects. So, forgive my use of terms like addict and dependence; I intend them as a guide rather than a diagnosis. The feedback I'm providing here is general and does not address physical dependence and various other factors relevant to your situation. One way to think about substance misuse is to view addiction as a disease that stems from avoidance. Allow me to reemphasize that it is a disease of avoidance. Your ultimate goal in living a balanced life is to identify what you are avoiding and develop alternative ways of managing those feelings and experiences. Along the journey, you may also want to consider triggers, situations, biological vulnerability, social pressures, coping skills, and relapse prevention planning. Depending on your stage of alcohol consumption, seeking professional expertise and support could significantly benefit you. Additionally, it's important to remember that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and weakens inhibitions. This means that alcohol is often chosen as a means of relaxation, stress reduction, and calming down. It also allows suppressed feelings, thoughts, and behaviors to come to the surface. If you frequently display infidelity or anger, that may be indicative of an underlying issue. For individuals prone to anger, it is often the case that alcohol is consumed as a means of expressing anger. I suggest finding someone with whom you can have open and informed discussions about addiction. Wishing you the best of health and wellness."}]}

If you have insurance, contact your policy provider and ask whether or not couples counseling is included. Aside from insurance, the next place that comes to mind is a religious affiliation. Do you belong to a church or other religious organization? Many of the pastors or leaders in these disciplines have significant training in counseling, as well as assisting with marriage and couples counseling. These services are ordinarily offered free of charge to members. Another option might be to explore support groups within the area.

In New York, you cannot institutionalize someone directly. However, you can contact the police or EMS. If they agree that hospitalization would benefit him, which seems likely, he can be held in the hospital for up to 72 hours, regardless of his agreement. Some hospitals may not keep a person that long, even if it's what we desire. I have witnessed numerous patients coming in and out of hospitals countless times, and in my experience, it can be extremely difficult to keep a person long enough to achieve stability and develop an appropriate aftercare plan. Hospitals in NYC often take a \"patch and release\" approach more frequently than I would prefer.\n\nIn my experience, family involvement makes a difference. A determined, knowledgeable, and persistent family can improve the quality of your loved one's care. Hospitals face significant pressure to discharge patients quickly, but they cannot discharge a homeless individual without a place to go. If your family is willing to accept your brother, that will be the easiest option for the hospital. If the family refuses, the hospital will be compelled to find an alternative solution. You can also urge the hospital to refer your brother to a rehab facility once he is stabilized from a psychiatric standpoint, which may only take a few days and give him more time to make clear-headed decisions.\n\nIf your brother has a psychiatrist, that person should be actively involved. I had a patient who was released multiple times, despite my advocacy and his desperate pleas to stay and stop his auditory hallucinations. Eventually, we managed to secure a 90-day hospitalization because I pressured his psychiatrist to demand that the hospital stabilize the patient. If your brother has a history of noncompliance with oral medications, you can advocate for him to receive injections, which again may help him maintain stability for a longer period of time.\n\nBest wishes to you and your family."}]}

If you feel sad on most days, it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer from clinical depression. Feeling sadness is a normal response to loss, whether you lose a family, friend, job, or something you deem important in your life. However, feeling sadness all the time is a signal that you are not happy about something in your life. If it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our self-esteem and self-worth, then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family. Is it that you do not feel heard, supported or loved? Is it that you feel disrespected, disregarded, or feel unimportant? These are just a few examples of common issues that people report that contribute to their depression. To help you uncover your reasons for your sadness or depression and to cope with them in a healthier and more constructive way, it may be helpful to contact a therapist who could support you with this process. You do not have to deal with it alone. For more information about depression, please consult the website."}]}

Adults who come from abusive home histories, whether physical, emotional, or psychological, may take a long time to heal from that abuse. We carry our past with us everywhere we go, and it is up to us to find resolutions to past hurts. This is often easier said than done, but it is possible. From the perspective of those with whom you have shared your concerns, it might be assumed that based on where you are in life and who you are now, you have already worked through any issues from your younger years. Some of our deepest scars in life are indeed invisible and suppressed. We have to get to the place where we can take care of the inner child that is still hurting by recognizing that those who hurt us, however they did, might have had their own challenges that prevented them from functioning and behaving in ways we deeply needed. Those who have directly hurt you may not be capable of acknowledging and understanding how you were affected by their actions even in the worst of cases. They themselves may be doing what they can, either out of shame or heartbreak for their own actions, to work on forgetting how they behaved toward you all those years before. How are they behaving toward you now? Can you find it in your heart to forgive those who have hurt you? Forgiveness is the gift we give ourselves and isn't dependent on an apology from an offender. By forgiving even in the absence of any apology, we are releasing the weight of the burden we are carrying that reflects the offense we feel was committed against us. Sometimes therapy can be helpful in this process. Talking with someone who can be nonjudgmental and reflects an empathetic position toward you might be what you need right now. Seeking out a therapist to help you work through these negative feelings and thoughts is much easier than trying to go it alone. I would encourage you to reach out and find someone who resonates with you on that journey so that you can begin a path toward healing. Warm regards."}]}

There are several possible reasons why you may be feeling insecure, but without knowing them, the issue is not likely to get resolved.

I have to wonder from a behavioral perspective if what you are doing is useful for you. In other words, does it serve a purpose in some way when you find yourself doing it. Yes, this could well be an expression of anxiety, or maybe some type of coping skill you have developed over the years to deal with stressful situations. Yet it sounds like you have developed a sort of knee-jerk behavioral conditioning that causes you to do this behavior during specific or perhaps even nonspecific circumstances. Do you think it is a self-soothing behavior? Do you feel good after you have done it? The behavior itself is likely causing some form of slow physical damage, so I would recommend you have yourself checked by a doctor, to rule out any injury. If none exists, this obviously doesn't excuse the behavior, it just says that for the moment luck is on your side.\n\nWhen we do any behavior of any kind, it is good to ask if what we are doing has merit or value. Is the behavior helping us to solve our problem, or is it merely creating yet another problem by doing the behavior in the first place. In the same way that a person might drink excessively because they are stressed and need to cope with some unresolved issue, when they are done drinking the original problem will still likely be there, but now they are intoxicated. No closer to solving the issue. When we deal with things like anxiety or depression, we need to do things that work on dealing with the symptoms, but also get to the root issue that created those feelings and find effective solutions. So the things we do to cope with life events need to not be ones that cause us harm, but rather support us as we move forward and work to deal with what life throws at us.\n\nSometimes seeking support from a friend or a counselor is a good idea. Being given the opportunity to express your feelings about what is going on around you and getting feedback and insight from others is much more effective than actions of self-harm, wouldn't you agree? So I would encourage you to find a counselor or a trusted friend who can help you find positive behaviors you can take to deal with your feelings, as you also work to find the answers to the day-to-day issues of living a life filled with promise and opportunity.\n\nReach out if you need help...there will likely be a hand there waiting for you."}]}

It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young good, bad, or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions, and I won't presume that my response to you will be the linchpin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects. Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you. Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...it's true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit. I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That's not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your spouse about what they want, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other, you will benefit from it. Be well."}]}

So, someone made you happy but is no longer around? I am sure that feels devastating. As a counselor, I usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external, rather than the internal side of a person's life. Happiness is formed within ourselves. All the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting and temporary. Even relationships do not last forever. If we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives, then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves. We are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy. Sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace or resolution to a specific problem.\n\nWhat I would offer to you is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself. What do you like about your life as it is right now? What can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness? These kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event. Mourning the loss of a social connection in whatever way that occurred is part of the grieving process, but it is not permanent. It is a path to healing and moving forward. From this, you can seek out new sources of happiness. I encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world. Happiness is an expression of the internal feelings, so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw. If you are lacking in happiness, then it becomes important to examine why that is and what you can do about it to promote self-care. Seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the grief-loss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supply.\n\nI wish you happiness for every day of your life.

Sometimes we jump from one relationship to another without giving ourselves a chance to adjust and grieve for the one we had to leave behind.

How long and/or how committed is the current relationship you are in now with your current partner?

Other friends might be upset at this sudden change, and it could create a strain on your friendship. You will want to carefully consider the value of that friendship before you take any actions that could damage it.

Has there been a change in events or behavior that would cause you to think of a valid reason to give that person a second chance?

No one else can make this choice for you. However, gaining the insight of friends or family can be helpful, as can seeking out the counsel of a therapist. In your heart, you will likely find the right answer. Learn to trust that more, as that is where the core of emotion tends to be when you need it.

You are asking a very good question about how to sustain a long-distance relationship. Although maintaining a long-distance relationship has its challenges, with the proper communication, commitment, and understanding, many long-distance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection. Without knowing more about the \"complicated\" nature of your relationship, I wonder whether your partner has given you reason not to trust them that makes you afraid that they will find someone else. Have they cheated on you in the past or shown romantic interest in another person that made you fear losing them? Or, is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence? Knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter, you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that make you feel good about them and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future. The more you focus on \"what if\" situations, the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure.\n\nHowever, if there is reason for you to question their fidelity, you may have to have a conversation with your partner about how to build trust in the context of a long-distance relationship. To help the conversation, you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship and to build trust. Is it that you wish for them to contact you regularly, or to include you more in their life, or to make a clear commitment? For many individuals in my private practice, that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of communication methods including text, phone, and video calls. It's hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner, and it's hard to build a relationship when you don't know what's going on in your partner's life. Other times, it is about making sure they talk often to their long-distance partner so that they can participate in each other's lives and feel their presence. Regular communication, understanding, and caring are the keys to sustaining any relationship, but this is especially true for long-distance ones."}]}

Is this normal?\n(Parenting Children Adolescents)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello. It sounds like you are really concerned about your child because you have noticed a significant change in their behavior. It's really a great first step that you are reaching out to get some ideas about what might be going on. You are clearly an observant and hands-on parent who wants to be sure that their child is okay.\n\nThis is a tough question to answer without more information. With that said, I have found that \"under stress people regress.\" In other words, many people, children, and adults alike, often regress and behave differently as if they were younger than their actual age when under stress. Therefore, my first question would be: has anything been happening recently that is causing your child stress? This could be anything from conflict at home, recent changes such as moving, divorce, a loss of some kind, switching schools, or losing a friend or friends. Additionally, sometimes if children are feeling bullied or left out by same-age peers, they may gravitate toward younger playmates as a way to boost their social confidence. I would suggest that you think about what stressors or changes may have occurred recently. You may also want to check in with their teachers to see if they have noticed any changes in your child's behavior at school.\n\nI also think that you can have a conversation with your child in order to see if you can get a sense of whether or not something has been bothering them. Something as simple as \"I have noticed that you aren't spending time with the friends you used to hang out with. It seems like you have been playing with a lot of younger kids lately. Am I right about that?\" And then if they say yes, you might ask a few questions such as \"Did something happen with your friends that is making you not want to be with them?\" \"Has something been bothering you lately? Are you feeling upset or worried?\" If they deny that there is anything wrong, you might even say \"I know that sometimes when I feel stressed or worried, I tend to act a little differently. Sometimes I withdraw from my regular group of friends, or I get cranky and feel less like myself. I wonder if something like that is happening with you?\"\n\nIf you are really concerned and not getting any answers from them and/or their teachers, perhaps you can consult with a therapist to discuss your concerns further and decide if it might help for your child to talk to a therapist a few times, or at the very least, you can get more specific tips from a therapist about how to approach this issue with your child more effectively. The more detail you can provide about what you have noticed with your child, including any changes or new stressors, any possible patterns to this behavior, if school has become more difficult socially and/or academically, the more a therapist can guide you about how best to handle your concerns and talk with your child in a way that is helpful to them.\n\nGood luck! I believe that this may just be a phase and it seems to me to be well within the normal range of children's behavior. I do, though, think that you will feel more assured about this if you can get to the bottom of what's going on."}]}

You both have very valid feelings, and those won't magically go away until you address the root problem, which could be many factors. I am curious to know more about past relationships you both have had and how that plays a role in your current relationship.
