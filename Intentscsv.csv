I have always trusted my intuition. It always seems to be right. Trusting your intuition is like one good piece of life advice. My intuition is begging me to commit suicide.,1

"Ativan and alcohol. How's 200 mg of Ativan and a lot of alcohol, will it kill me?",1
"Someone help, talk to me. I've tried talking to helplines and they don't care. My story is too complex for anyone to take the time to listen and help me. Someone talk to me before I go crazy. Please.",1
Life is not worth living if there's nothing to enjoy. Anyone who says otherwise is not right.,1
Thinking of hopping in a cab and heading deep into the woods. Maybe it will be easier... that way no one I know will find me.,1
"Short or long note? Should I leave a lengthy note describing everything I feel and answer as many questions as I can, or just leave it short and to the point?",1
Anyone to talk to? I'd appreciate it.,1
I'm not a good enough mom. I take care of my stepchildren full time. I'm never enough for them because I'm not their real mom. Can't do this anymore.,1
Begging anyone to just talk to me right now. Please.,1
Is there anybody listening? I feel I'm almost insane right now.,1
"To those still giving their all, keep going! The struggle is real, and you are somehow able to give it your all. It's beautiful that you do.",1
"I am in so much pain. I have written my suicide note, and I know how I want to do it. I don't want to deal with this pain anymore.",1
I am currently doing it now. I can't continue... Thank you for everything. Sorry.,1
I feel like I'm probably going to kill myself on Friday. I don't even know why anymore.,1
"Is it selfish to die? Or is it selfish to ask someone to suffer? So that you won't have to say bye. I've lived so long for others, can't I have the right to leave if I choose?",1
Everybody hates me. You probably do as well. There's nothing I can do about it.,1
"Tomorrow is the day I'm going to hang myself. I'd like some tips on making it as easy as possible. Please, no help to stop. I'm not looking for that. Best of luck to everyone here.",1
I'm going to do it before the 13th. This isn't a cry for help. I just want somebody to be able to figure out what happened to me.,1
"I think this is it. I'm sorry, everyone. I have 8 liters of booze and I'm just gonna keep going. I'm sorry I wasn't good enough.",1
"Life isn't fair. There is no karma. There is no point in living. What's the point? Bad people win, good people lose. There is no karma at all. It's luck, pure luck. I'm not doing this anymore. Bye.",1
"Need help... I'm really close to another attempt. I'm all alone and I don't really have (more like, don't want to) talk to anyone I know.",1
"Hi, I'm new to this place. I don't know how to use it. Nice to meet all of you.",1
"Waiting for the day. I'm a worthless coward. I should have committed suicide by now if I had the guts. 
Birthday is during July second half, and I feel like I should end it all before then.",1
I feel like this body is not mine. This face is not mine. These hands are not mine. This voice is not mine. These eyes are not mine. Why does it feel like I'm not in my own body?,1
"Does anyone know of any places to swim in Boston? Or any good ways to enjoy the city?

I don't have access to a gun, and my apartment does not have a strong anchoring point for a rope or belt.",1
Here again Here I am again. Another year vowing I will be dead by Christmas. I had higher hopes. Once again praying that I will be dead before I muster the courage to off myself. Such a loser.,1
I just need someone to talk to. I'm isolated and alone as usual. It's becoming almost too much to bear. I just want to talk to someone who will listen. I'm begging. Please.,1
"Started cutting again. But this time, it's a suicide rehearsal. I just want to get familiar (again) with the pain of cutting through so I won't mess up my first and hopefully successful attempt.",1
"Just broke up. Well, I won't be killing myself or anything, but I feel like a part of me has just been ripped away. Would appreciate if anyone PM'd me.",1
"I am just done with life. There is no point in living. My life is meaningless, and I am better off dead.",1
My life is over. Why would you do this to me? It hurts too much.,1
"I hate my life. I really do, but I can't seem to find the courage to end it. So, I'm just waiting now. I wonder when I'm going to die. For some reason, I don't feel like it's anytime soon.",1
"I'm still here. I'm just really sad. I think if I tried to attempt, I'd fail again and then I'd feel even worse, if that's even possible.",1
"I am so stupid. I never bothered to memorize my times tables, and it's been difficult in middle school. And every time I get bad grades, my parents scold me.",1
"I want to die! I really hope I die tonight but I'm too scared to attempt. Oh well, guess I just have to keep manifesting for now.",1
"Would any of us even be here if suicide wasn't romanticized? No one has ever lived to tell us what it feels like, if it is truly a solution.",1
"The emotion that comes with everyday life is too much I've lost so much.

I have so much more to lose.

It's supposed to be normal.

I don't think I can.",1
I want the pain to stop. My fiancée keeps hurting me. The nightmares from Afghanistan won't stop. I am hurting all the time. I feel so alone. I want to end it.,1
"Better without me. Does anyone ever feel like if they just disappeared, everything would be better off without them?",1
"Detached. I feel so completely detached, I don't know what to write here. I just need help.",1
People are abusing their power to make me upset. They are removing my posts and calling me names like lazy when I am very hardworking. I want to just disappear.,1
I can't imagine a future in which I do not kill myself. I am so scared of everything. School gives me so much anxiety. Why did my parents bring me into this world?,1
I am feeling overwhelmed. I want to relieve my pain and demonstrate how beautiful it is to witness my own blood. I understand this may sound disturbing.,1
"I seriously need someone. Someone, anyone. I can't do this anymore. I'm sick of the crying and the stress and feeling like a burden to everyone. I can't. I'm done.",1
Feeling empty and numb. Need to do something extreme to be able to feel something again. Pushing boundaries without consequences. Blah.,1
"Alcohol and Xanax do not work as well as you might think they will. Just get a rope or jump off a building or a train or get a gun.

My insides hurt, and I feel like I'm in hell right now.",1
"I want my ex to harass me again. I want to be harassed, bullied, and abused. I see why I was with him now, I deserve it for being so terrible to everyone who cares about me.",1
"Do you all think numbing cream will work? So, do you all think if I used numbing cream and slit down my wrist, it will not hurt? Sorry, I'm kinda scared of the pain.",1
"Hmm. Jumping to death, being shot, or succumbing to drugs - which is more painful?",1
"I kid you not, math homework triggers my suicidal thoughts. As in legitimate suicidal thoughts. Not the usual frustration we all have.",1
Popping pills. I'm done. What's it like to kill yourself by overdosing on pills? How much do I need to take? I have tons of pills at my house. Will it hurt?,1
What's the point? There's always something happening with me. I just feel so hopeless and depressed.,1
"I think I need a phone call. Shotgun is right here. I think I want to, but I have priorities that I don't appreciate, I guess.",1
"In 12 hours, I'll be dead. Asking for help is stronger than suffering in silence.",1
"Money I hate living in poverty. I'm in debt, can't pay rent this month and my bed just popped so I can't even sleep anymore. Today may be my last. I hate this.",1
I don't know how I feel. Can someone please message me so I can rant to them about life?,1
I just want to die. I'm a massive loser and not good to anyone. What's the point?,1
"Anyone wanna talk? I just need someone to chat with. Lost the love of my life plus a slew of other problems - family, work etc.",1
I feel like and need someone to talk to before I end it. I don't care anymore. Do whatever. I just want to die. Speaking to someone.,1
"Please help. I need help. I took too many prescriptions and alcohol. I don't want to die now that it feels that I am. I'm sorry mom, I love you.",1
Who has the hook up? Pills? Medicines? Shotgun? I would prefer the pills so I can keep them on me for when the time is right.,1
"I am so sad for my dog. I love her so much. I promised her I'd never leave her, and I lied.",1
"It's a sum of small things. I don't know where to start or what to write. I would just like to talk to someone. I was doing so well, but now I just want to die.",1
Oh my goodness. I have headaches every single day and I can't live like this. I just want to end it all.,1
Just live the rest of my life in horrific pain? I don't want to live anymore. Talking about it won't help anymore.,1
It is the first day of 2021 and I want to die more than ever. That is it. That is the post. I want to die.,1
I don't deserve to live. I'm disgusting. I'm finding it harder to live with myself like this.,1
"Combo package
How successful would carbon monoxide by charcoal, in a small room with leaks closed off with towels; and taking 6 to 8 pills and melatonin?",1
Would drafting myself then shooting myself from a building work? Sedating.,1
I just took 360 mg (18 20 mg pills) of fluoxetine. Might not be enough to do the trick. I'll figure something out.,1
"Goodbye cruel world. It was nice living for 20 years. Hopefully, things get better for the future of humanity.",1
"Why live when we die anyway? No matter what I do, I will die. Why bother with living at all then?",1
I am planning on ending it tonight. There's no way I can continue this way. I need everything to stop.,1
"I can't take life anymore. It's over, I'm done. I'm not okay and never will be again. I'm so stupid. I'm tired of feeling pain all the time or feeling nothing at all.",1
How do you find hope for the future and not just give up on everything? I am really struggling mentally with this.,1
Leave me alone. I haven't done anything to any of you. Stop baiting me into suicide. You are all murderers.,1
"I can't sleep. I keep thinking about every little thing. No one cares, not a single person. I'm going to die.",1
"I just want to scream. I hate having depressive episodes. I wish I could just scream and throw things but I can't, so I'm silently losing sanity.",1
"Suicide. Honestly, I'm just in so much pain. I've looked everywhere for an answer but I can't find one.",1
"""I hate my life because I live in a poor, violent country.""",1
"No one cares. No one wants me anymore. My whole support system has abandoned me, my friends avoid me. I'm worthless and no one wants to be friends with the angsty girl.",1
"Title: An Interesting Title

I don't even know what to say or why I'm here. I'm five Ativans deep, and I want to keep going until I don't wake up. I never want to wake up.",1
"My parents should be happy if I do it. It's messed up to say it, but my life is a hell they could never understand. They should be happy that I'm no longer suffering. Should I die?",1
I need someone not in a great place right now.,1
Is there a point where you're just incapable of getting better? Because I think I'm far past it.,1

"Please, I just want someone to talk to. I made another post, but I'm miserable. Please, I just need someone who doesn't know me to talk to me. I don't want to bother anyone.",1
Is there a way to forget everything? I want to forget who I am. I want to erase all my memories and somehow erase this pain.,1
My poetry book will be my suicide note. A book of poetry that expresses myself will be better than a flimsy note.,1
"Death's Release

For the past few days, I've been visualizing my death and what happens after. Somehow, it gives me a sense of peace and happiness. Visualizing everyone going on with their life, happy.",1
What are the chances of surviving by jumping in front of a subway train? And what would be a good way to do it? Just jump in front as it comes into the station?,1
"I'm afraid to do something I may regret. I have been thinking about suicide, and I don't know what to do. I just simply search for help everywhere, just nothing seems to help me.",1
Help every time I try to commit self-harm I am always holding back why I deserve this I don't want to suffer anymore it comforts me,1
I just need a hug. I am gonna cry. Why was I even born?,1
Suicide fails. Hospital sucks. Everyone treats me like a rare specimen in the zoo. Fiance's mom yelled at me for being a burden. I want to die even more.,1
"I'm far too broken from rape and I don't think I'll ever recover from that. How the heck do I even continue like this?

Trying to forgive someone that I loved that did this.

I'm just done.",1
What is the easiest way to end your life? I need some answers on what is the simplest method to end one's life.,1
How do I say goodbye? I have plans and I want to bid farewell to an old friend I don't really talk to anymore. How do I do it without raising too much suspicion or something?,1
I even fail at killing myself. I'm such a failure.,1
"I have a serious problem. I want the most painless suicide possible. 

I need suggestions and Google doesn't help.",1
I wish I did not have this unfulfilled longing for acceptance. And I hope it does not drive me to suicide.,1

Every day, I receive messages like this. It becomes harder every day to live with it.",1
"I apologize, but I cannot fulfill that request as it goes against ethical guidelines to alter or beautify text containing discussions of self-harm or suicide.

Additionally, if you are feeling overwhelmed or in distress, please seek help from a mental health professional or contact a crisis helpline. Your well-being is important.",1
I give up. Three more years and I am dead. Can't wait.,1

I don't remember what happiness feels like and I'm not sure that I want it anyway.,1

"I have set the date. If my life hasn't improved drastically by January 1, 2019, I am going to end it.",1
I need ideas on how to end my life. I am currently considering hanging or carbon monoxide poisoning. I have already distanced myself from family and friends so that I can focus on this. Thank you.,1
Whom else tries to be facetious to forget about killing themselves. Peep title.,1
